    "content": "Here are 10 possible mechanics/abilities for \"Mana-Core Eruption\":\n\n1.  **Oracle text:** Mana-Core Eruption deals 4 damage to each creature and each opponent. You may return a land you control to your hand. If you do, you may put a land card from your hand onto the battlefield.\n    *   **Complexity:** 7 (AOE damage 3 + optional land return 2 + optional land drop 2)\n    *   **Flavor:** 5 (The eruption causes widespread damage, then Wayfinders quickly adapt by shifting their land-world's position, representing resource management and the shifting nature of the archipelago.)\n    *   **Synergy:** 5 (Directly supports \"Landfall\" by enabling a trigger, and aligns with red's destructive tendencies and themes of \"Mana as Fuel\" for re-establishing a land connection.)\n\n2.  **Oracle text:** Mana-Core Eruption deals 5 damage to target player or planeswalker. Until the end of your next turn, whenever you cast a noncreature spell, you may add {R}{R} to your mana pool.\n    *   **Complexity:** 7 (Targeted damage 3 + delayed mana trigger for specific spell type 4)\n    *   **Flavor:** 5 (A concentrated eruption deals a massive blow, and the unleashed mana lingers, ready to be channeled into subsequent magical efforts.)\n    *   **Synergy:** 5 (Strong synergy with \"Prowess\" creatures, providing abundant mana to chain noncreature spells. Fits \"Mana as Fuel\" and red's spell-slinging nature.)\n\n3.  **Oracle text:** As an additional cost to cast this spell, sacrifice any number of lands. Mana-Core Eruption deals X damage to each non-land permanent and each opponent, where X is the number of lands sacrificed this way. You gain X mana of any one color.\n    *   **Complexity:** 7 (Sacrifice cost 2 + scaling AOE damage 3 + mana gain 2)\n    *   **Flavor:** 5 (A desperate, catastrophic measure where a Wayfinder sacrifices parts of their island-world for an overwhelming burst of destructive power, temporarily siphoning immense raw mana.)\n    *   **Synergy:** 4 (Fits the \"Mana as Fuel\" theme dramatically and black-red \"Mana Siphoners\" archetype, leveraging resource sacrifice for explosive effects.)\n\n4.  **Oracle text:** Mana-Core Eruption deals 5 damage to target creature or planeswalker and 2 damage to each other creature.\n    Flashback {4RR}, sacrifice a land.\n    *   **Complexity:** 7 (Targeted damage 2 + AOE damage 2 + Flashback with additional cost 3)\n    *   **Flavor:** 5 (The initial eruption is devastating. The ability to \"flashback\" represents the persistent instability of a mana core or a repeated, desperate siphoning, potentially guided by ancestral spirits or the destructive will of High Priestess Xylara.)\n    *   **Synergy:** 5 (Utilizes \"Flashback,\" a key set mechanic for calling upon past power, and directly ties into \"Mana as Fuel\" and destructive themes with the land sacrifice.)\n\n5.  **Oracle text:** Mana-Core Eruption deals 4 damage to each creature. It deals 2 damage to each opponent. You may put a land card from your hand onto the battlefield. If you do, scry 2.\n    *   **Complexity:** 8 (AOE creature damage 3 + AOE opponent damage 2 + optional land drop 2 + conditional scry 1)\n    *   **Flavor:** 5 (A widespread catastrophic event clears threats, and in the aftermath, Wayfinders can quickly establish new footing (landfall) and divine their next course (scry).)\n    *   **Synergy:** 5 (Combines red's destructive power with \"Landfall\" and \"Scry,\" both primary mechanics, aligning with Wayfinding's need to navigate and adapt after cataclysmic events.)\n\n6.  **Oracle text:** Exile Mana-Core Eruption as it resolves. At the beginning of your next upkeep, put X 1/1 red Elemental creature tokens onto the battlefield, where X is the number of lands you control. Those tokens have \"This creature gets +1/+0 for each Mountain you control.\"\n    *   **Complexity:** 7 (Exile 1 + delayed token creation with variable amount 4 + conditional buff 2)\n    *   **Flavor:** 5 (The eruption is a massive force of creation and destruction, transforming raw mana into volatile Elementals that surge from the land, becoming stronger with the presence of volcanic mana.)\n    *   **Synergy:** 4 (Plays into \"Mana as Fuel\" and \"Landfall\" by rewarding having many lands. Fits red's Elemental themes and the \"Volcanic Growth\" archetype.)\n\n7.  **Oracle text:** Mana-Core Eruption deals 3 damage to each creature. Lands your opponents control lose all abilities and become basic Mountains until the end of your next turn.\n    *   **Complexity:** 7 (AOE damage 3 + temporary land modification 4)\n    *   **Flavor:** 5 (The eruption damages creatures, and the raw mana flow from the unstable core temporarily overwhelms enemy island-worlds, disrupting their natural properties and converting them into volatile red mana sources.)\n    *   **Synergy:** 4 (Aligns with red's aggressive disruption and desire to dominate mana sources. Provides tempo against opponents relying on non-basic lands.)\n\n8.  **Oracle text:** Mana-Core Eruption deals 6 damage to target player or planeswalker. If you control a creature with prowess, this spell deals 2 damage to each of up to two other targets.\n    *   **Complexity:** 7 (Targeted damage 2 + conditional additional damage with multiple targets 3 + prowess check 2)\n    *   **Flavor:** 5 (A focused, destructive burst of mana. If a skilled Wayfinder or Tattooed warrior is present (Prowess), they can deftly channel the overflow into additional precise strikes.)\n    *   **Synergy:** 5 (Directly rewards having \"Prowess\" creatures, a primary red mechanic, making this a powerful finisher or removal spell in UR or WR spellslinger archetypes.)\n\n9.  **Oracle text:** Mana-Core Eruption deals 3 damage to each creature an opponent controls. Put a +1/+1 counter on each creature you control. If you put one or more +1/+1 counters on creatures this way, draw a card.\n    *   **Complexity:** 7 (Targeted AOE damage 3 + mass counter placement 2 + conditional card draw 2)\n    *   **Flavor:** 5 (The eruption devastates enemy creatures, but simultaneously infuses your own forces with raw mana, strengthening their \"Tatau\" and granting new insights (drawing a card) from the mana surge.)\n    *   **Synergy:** 5 (Excellent synergy with \"Tatau\" creatures, immediately strengthening them and potentially enabling their abilities, while providing card advantage.)\n\n10. **Oracle text:** Destroy target land. Add {R}{R}{R}{R} to your mana pool. At the beginning of your next end step, sacrifice a land.\n    *   **Complexity:** 7 (Targeted destruction 2 + massive mana gain 2 + delayed sacrifice 3)\n    *   **Flavor:** 5 (A direct, aggressive act of siphoning immense mana from a chosen island-world, granting an immediate power surge but incurring a lingering cost due to the instability it causes.)\n    *   **Synergy:** 4 (Fits the \"Mana as Fuel\" theme perfectly. Enables powerful plays by providing a huge temporary mana boost, but with a drawback representing the cost of such an extreme action. Good for BR \"Mana Siphoners.\")"
