  "prompt": "Background Context:\nProject Context:\n- set_theme: A vibrant cosmic voyage set blending Polynesian wayfinding culture with interstellar exploration.\n\nThe Vela Archipelago - scattered island-worlds across a nebula-sea where ancient wayfinders navigate \nusing both star charts and ancestral spirits. Their great canoe-ships ride cosmic currents between \nworlds, powered by mana drawn from volcanic cores and celestial convergences.\n\nKey themes:\n- Wayfinding: Navigation using stars, currents, and spirit guides across both ocean and space\n- Ancestor spirits: Departed navigators whose spirits guide the living through dangerous passages\n- Mana as fuel: Volcanic/stellar energy that powers both magic and interstellar travel\n- Tattoo magic (Tatau): Sacred markings that store power, record lineage, and enable abilities\n- The Great Voyage: An ongoing journey to unite scattered island-worlds under one chiefdom\n- Cosmic sea creatures: Massive beings that swim between stars - some helpful guides, others apex predators\n- Coral nebulae: Beautiful but treacherous regions of space filled with life and danger\n\nVisual motifs: Intricate tribal patterns, bioluminescent creatures, volcanic islands floating in starfields,\noutrigger starships with solar sails, warriors with glowing tattoos, coral formations in nebula clouds.\n\n- set_size: 6\n\nCurrent Asset:\n- name: Ancestral Star-Whisperer\n- card_type: Creature - Spirit Wizard\n- rarity: Uncommon\n- color: Blue\n- concept: Ancestral Star-Whisperers are the revered spirits of master navigators, their luminous forms flickering within the nebulae, continuously charting the cosmic currents even after death. They serve as ethereal guides, their subtle whispers providing crucial directional insights and forewarnings to the living Wayfinders undertaking the Great Voyage against the Void Blight. Mechanically, they embody blue's mastery over knowledge and destiny, allowing players to manipulate the flow of information or predict future events, reflecting their celestial foresight.\n- mechanics_brainstorm: Here are 10 possible mechanics/abilities for the \"Ancestral Star-Whisperer\" card, designed to fit its concept, color, rarity, and the set's themes and mechanics:\n\n---\n\n1.  **Flying. When Ancestral Star-Whisperer enters the battlefield, scry 2.**\n    *   Complexity: 3 (1 for Flying, 2 for ETB Scry 2).\n    *   Flavor: 5 (Ethereal spirit navigating the cosmic sea, providing initial insights).\n    *   Synergy: 5 (Directly uses \"Scry,\" a primary blue mechanic representing wayfinding).\n\n2.  **At the beginning of your upkeep, scry 1.**\n    *   Complexity: 2.\n    *   Flavor: 5 (Represents the spirit's continuous charting of cosmic currents and ongoing guidance).\n    *   Synergy: 5 (Consistent \"Scry\" value, reinforcing the blue wayfinding theme).\n\n3.  **Spells with flashback in your graveyard cost {1} less to cast.**\n    *   Complexity: 2.\n    *   Flavor: 4 (The wisdom of departed navigators makes ancient rituals and knowledge more accessible).\n    *   Synergy: 5 (Directly supports \"Flashback,\" a primary blue mechanic for ancestor spirits).\n\n4.  **{1}{U}, {T}: Look at the top three cards of your library. Put one into your hand and the rest on the bottom of your library in any order.**\n    *   Complexity: 3.\n    *   Flavor: 5 (A deeper form of divination, allowing precise selection of future knowledge).\n    *   Synergy: 4 (Emphasizes knowledge and destiny manipulation, a core blue theme, as an activated ability).\n\n5.  **Whenever you scry, you may look at the top card of an opponent's library. You may put it on the bottom of their library.**\n    *   Complexity: 3.\n    *   Flavor: 4 (Using foresight not just for self, but also to anticipate or subtly disrupt an opponent's path, reflecting \"forewarnings\").\n    *   Synergy: 4 (Encourages and rewards other \"Scry\" effects on your board).\n\n6.  **Ancestral Star-Whisperer has \"Whenever you cast an instant or sorcery spell, scry 1.\"**\n    *   Complexity: 3.\n    *   Flavor: 4 (The spirit's presence allows for quick insights as you channel magic, akin to skill in navigation).\n    *   Synergy: 5 (Synergizes with blue's spell-slinging nature and directly uses \"Scry\").\n\n7.  **When Ancestral Star-Whisperer dies, you may cast target instant or sorcery card with flashback from your graveyard this turn.**\n    *   Complexity: 3.\n    *   Flavor: 5 (A final, powerful act of guidance or a last will from the departed spirit, making ancient wisdom available at a critical moment).\n    *   Synergy: 5 (Strong \"Flashback\" payoff for an ancestor spirit, even in death).\n\n8.  **Whenever you scry, put a +1/+1 counter on target Wayfinder creature you control.**\n    *   Complexity: 3.\n    *   Flavor: 4 (The spirit's guidance and charting efforts empower the living Wayfinders on their journey).\n    *   Synergy: 3 (Rewards \"Scry\" and supports a key creature type of the set, connecting themes).\n\n9.  **Ancestral Star-Whisperer has ward {2}.**\n    *   Complexity: 2.\n    *   Flavor: 4 (Represents the ethereal nature of the spirit, making it harder for foes to interact with or harm it).\n    *   Synergy: 3 (A common blue protection ability, fitting for a wise, valuable creature).\n\n10. **Whenever you scry, you may tap or untap target permanent.**\n    *   Complexity: 3.\n    *   Flavor: 4 (The spirit's subtle whispers and knowledge allow you to manipulate cosmic currents or mana flows to your advantage).\n    *   Synergy: 3 (Rewards \"Scry\" with a versatile blue control effect, reflecting manipulation of the environment).\n- card_json: ```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"Ancestral Star-Whisperer\",\n  \"supertype\": \"Creature\",\n  \"subtype\": \"Spirit Wizard\",\n  \"mana_cost\": \"{2}{U}\",\n  \"power\": \"1\",\n  \"toughness\": \"3\",\n  \"rule_text\": \"Flying\\nAt the beginning of your upkeep, scry 1.\\nSpells with flashback in your graveyard cost {1} less to cast.\",\n  \"rarity\": \"Uncommon\"\n}\n```\n\nPrevious Step 'design_set_mechanics':\nHere is the mechanical framework for your Magic: The Gathering set, \"The Vela Archipelago\":\n\n---\n\n## 1.
