  "prompt": "Background Context:\nProject Context:\n- set_theme: A vibrant cosmic voyage set blending Polynesian wayfinding culture with interstellar exploration.\n\nThe Vela Archipelago - scattered island-worlds across a nebula-sea where ancient wayfinders navigate \nusing both star charts and ancestral spirits. Their great canoe-ships ride cosmic currents between \nworlds, powered by mana drawn from volcanic cores and celestial convergences.\n\nKey themes:\n- Wayfinding: Navigation using stars, currents, and spirit guides across both ocean and space\n- Ancestor spirits: Departed navigators whose spirits guide the living through dangerous passages\n- Mana as fuel: Volcanic/stellar energy that powers both magic and interstellar travel\n- Tattoo magic (Tatau): Sacred markings that store power, record lineage, and enable abilities\n- The Great Voyage: An ongoing journey to unite scattered island-worlds under one chiefdom\n- Cosmic sea creatures: Massive beings that swim between stars - some helpful guides, others apex predators\n- Coral nebulae: Beautiful but treacherous regions of space filled with life and danger\n\nVisual motifs: Intricate tribal patterns, bioluminescent creatures, volcanic islands floating in starfields,\noutrigger starships with solar sails, warriors with glowing tattoos, coral formations in nebula clouds.\n\n- set_size: 6\n\nCurrent Asset:\n- name: Ancestral Star-Whisperer\n- card_type: Creature - Spirit Wizard\n- rarity: Uncommon\n- color: Blue\n- concept: The Ancestral Star-Whisperer is an ethereal elder, a departed Wayfinder whose spirit still navigates the cosmic currents, manifesting to guide the living through the treacherous nebula-sea. Their ancient wisdom is crucial for charting safe passages and deciphering obscure constellations, especially as the Void Blight twists familiar star-paths. Mechanically, they represent blue's connection to knowledge and foresight, likely offering powerful scrying or card manipulation abilities, perhaps even bringing back other spirits from the celestial depths.\n- mechanics_brainstorm: Here are 10 possible mechanical designs for the \"Ancestral Star-Whisperer,\" keeping its concept, blue color identity, and the set's mechanics and rarity in mind.\n\n1.  **Oracle Text:** When Ancestral Star-Whisperer enters the battlefield, scry 2. You may return target Spirit creature card with mana value 3 or less from your graveyard to your hand.\n    *   Complexity 5. Flavor 5. Synergy 5.\n    *(This ability directly addresses the \"guidance\" through scry and \"bringing back other spirits from celestial depths\" mentioned in the concept, while also aligning with blue's primary mechanics of Scry and Flashback synergy (via graveyard interaction). Mana value restriction keeps it uncommon.)*\n\n2.  **Oracle Text:** {1}{U}, {T}: Scry 2.\n    Flashback {2}{U}\n    *(Note: For this ability, the Ancestral Star-Whisperer would have a normal mana cost and P/T on the card. This Flashback ability means the creature itself can be cast from the graveyard.)*\n    *   Complexity 5. Flavor 5. Synergy 5.\n    *(This design emphasizes the spirit's ethereal nature and its ability to manifest and recede. It provides ongoing guidance (activated scry) and allows the spirit's wisdom to be called upon again from the graveyard (Flashback), perfectly fitting the \"departed Wayfinder\" theme and primary blue mechanics.)*\n\n3.  **Oracle Text:** Spells you cast from your graveyard cost {1} less to cast.\n    Whenever you cast a spell from your graveyard, scry 1.\n    *   Complexity 5. Flavor 5. Synergy 5.\n    *(This design strongly supports the \"Flashback\" mechanic by making ancestral magic more accessible and rewarding its use with Scry, representing gaining further insight or charting new paths from rediscovered wisdom.)*\n\n4.  **Oracle Text:** Flying\n    Whenever you scry, if you put one or more cards on the bottom of your library this way, draw a card.\n    *   Complexity 5. Flavor 4. Synergy 5.\n    *(Flying is standard for a spirit. The triggered ability rewards successful \"wayfinding\" (putting unwanted cards to the bottom) with new knowledge (drawing a card), a classic blue card advantage effect.)*\n\n5.  **Oracle Text:** Ancestral Star-Whisperer can crew Vehicles as though its power were 2 higher.\n    Whenever Ancestral Star-Whisperer crews a Vehicle, scry 1.\n    *   Complexity 4. Flavor 4. Synergy 4.\n    *(This highlights the \"Wayfinder\" aspect of the spirit, guiding great canoe-ships. It supports the set's \"Vehicles\" mechanic and ties it to \"Scry,\" representing the spirit's ancient navigational prowess.)*\n\n6.  **Oracle Text:** Other Spirit creatures you control get +1/+0.\n    {T}: Scry 1.\n    *   Complexity 4. Flavor 4. Synergy 4.\n    *(A more straightforward tribal lord effect for Spirits, representing the elder spirit empowering its kin. The activated Scry offers consistent, simple guidance, fitting the ongoing wisdom aspect.)*\n\n7.  **Oracle Text:** {2}{U}, {T}: You may return target Spirit creature card from your graveyard to your hand. If that card had Flashback, scry 1.\n    *   Complexity 5. Flavor 5. Synergy 5.\n    *(This is another solid take on bringing back spirits from the depths, but as an activated ability. The conditional Scry rewards synergy with the set's Flashback mechanic, representing special insight gained from a spirit with recurring knowledge.)*\n\n8.  **Oracle Text:** Prowess\n    Whenever Ancestral Star-Whisperer deals combat damage to a player, scry 2.\n    *   Complexity 5. Flavor 3. Synergy 4.\n    *(Prowess, while a primary blue mechanic, might feel slightly aggressive for an \"elder spirit.\" However, it can represent the spirit's temporary surge of power in guiding through dangerous passages. The Scry on combat damage still fits the \"deciphering constellations\" concept.)*\n\n9.  **Oracle Text:** When Ancestral Star-Whisperer enters the battlefield, scry 2.\n    Spells you cast that instruct you to scry cost {1} less to cast.\n    *   Complexity 4. Flavor 4. Synergy 5.\n    *(This design focuses purely on Scry, immediately providing guidance and then making subsequent \"wayfinding\" spells easier to cast, reinforcing blue's role as the master navigator.)*\n\n10. **Oracle Text:** When Ancestral Star-Whisperer enters the battlefield, mill 2, then scry 1.\n    Whenever you cast a spell from your graveyard, draw a card.\n    *   Complexity 6. Flavor 5. Synergy 5.\n    *(This is a slightly more complex uncommon that provides immediate value by filling the graveyard for Flashback and then guiding the way. The triggered draw effect rewards the use of Flashback spells, representing newfound knowledge gained from ancestral wisdom.)*\n- card_json: ```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"Ancestral Star-Whisperer\",\n  \"supertype\": \"Creature\",\n  \"subtype\": \"Spirit Wizard\",\n  \"mana_cost\": \"{1}{U}\",\n  \"power\": \"1\",\n  \"toughness\": \"2\",\n  \"rule_text\": \"{1}{U}, {T}: Scry 2.\\nFlashback {2}{U} (You may cast this card from your graveyard for its Flashback cost.
