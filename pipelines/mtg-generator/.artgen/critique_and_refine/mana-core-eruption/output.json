  "prompt": "Background Context:\nProject Context:\n- set_theme: A vibrant cosmic voyage set blending Polynesian wayfinding culture with interstellar exploration.\n\nThe Vela Archipelago - scattered island-worlds across a nebula-sea where ancient wayfinders navigate \nusing both star charts and ancestral spirits. Their great canoe-ships ride cosmic currents between \nworlds, powered by mana drawn from volcanic cores and celestial convergences.\n\nKey themes:\n- Wayfinding: Navigation using stars, currents, and spirit guides across both ocean and space\n- Ancestor spirits: Departed navigators whose spirits guide the living through dangerous passages\n- Mana as fuel: Volcanic/stellar energy that powers both magic and interstellar travel\n- Tattoo magic (Tatau): Sacred markings that store power, record lineage, and enable abilities\n- The Great Voyage: An ongoing journey to unite scattered island-worlds under one chiefdom\n- Cosmic sea creatures: Massive beings that swim between stars - some helpful guides, others apex predators\n- Coral nebulae: Beautiful but treacherous regions of space filled with life and danger\n\nVisual motifs: Intricate tribal patterns, bioluminescent creatures, volcanic islands floating in starfields,\noutrigger starships with solar sails, warriors with glowing tattoos, coral formations in nebula clouds.\n\n- set_size: 6\n\nCurrent Asset:\n- name: Mana-Core Eruption\n- card_type: Sorcery\n- rarity: Rare\n- color: Red\n- concept: \"Mana-Core Eruption\" depicts the catastrophic release of raw cosmic energy from an island-world's volcanic heart, a devastating event often triggered by the Mana Devourer's corrupting influence or High Priestess Xylara's reckless mana siphoning. This rare red sorcery embodies immense, indiscriminate power, offering players a potent but volatile burst of mana or widespread destruction, reflecting the dangers and opportunities within the Archipelago's unstable energy network.\n- mechanics_brainstorm: Here are 10 potential mechanics for the \"Mana-Core Eruption\" card:\n\n1.  **Choose one or both \u2014\n    *   Add {R}{R}{R}{R} to your mana pool.\n    *   Mana-Core Eruption deals 3 damage to each creature and each planeswalker.** Complexity 4. Flavor 5. Synergy 4.\n2.  **Mana-Core Eruption deals 4 damage to each creature and each planeswalker. Then, if you control three or more Mountains, add {R}{R}{R}{R}{R} to your mana pool. Otherwise, add {R}{R} to your mana pool.** Complexity 4. Flavor 5. Synergy 5.\n3.  **Mana-Core Eruption deals X damage to each creature and each planeswalker, where X is the number of Mountains you control. Add {R} to your mana pool for each creature dealt damage this way.** Complexity 4. Flavor 5. Synergy 5.\n4.  **As an additional cost to cast this spell, sacrifice a land. Mana-Core Eruption deals 5 damage to each creature and each planeswalker. Then, untap up to three lands you control and add {R} to your mana pool for each land untap this way.** Complexity 4. Flavor 5. Synergy 5.\n5.  **Roll a six-sided die. Add that many {R} to your mana pool. Mana-Core Eruption deals damage equal to the result to each creature and each planeswalker. If the result was 6, Mana-Core Eruption deals 6 damage to each opponent.** Complexity 4. Flavor 5. Synergy 4.\n6.  **Mana-Core Eruption deals 3 damage to each creature. Until your next turn, whenever a land enters the battlefield under your control, add {R}{R} to your mana pool.** Complexity 4. Flavor 5. Synergy 5.\n7.  **Mana-Core Eruption deals 2 damage to each creature. Put two +1/+1 counters on each creature with Tatau. Add {R}{R}{R} to your mana pool.** Complexity 4. Flavor 4. Synergy 5.\n8.  **Mana-Core Eruption deals 2 damage to each creature. For each creature dealt damage this way, add {R} to your mana pool. Then discard a card.** Complexity 4. Flavor 5. Synergy 4.\n9.  **Mana-Core Eruption deals 2 damage to each creature. Lands you control have \"Tap: Add {R}\" in addition to their other abilities until end of turn. Those lands untap.** Complexity 4. Flavor 5. Synergy 5.\n10. **As an additional cost to cast this spell, you may pay {X}. If you do, Mana-Core Eruption deals X damage to each creature and each planeswalker. Then add {R}{R}{R} to your mana pool.** Complexity 4. Flavor 5. Synergy 4.\n- card_json: ```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"Mana-Core Eruption\",\n  \"supertype\": \"Sorcery\",\n  \"subtype\": \"\",\n  \"mana_cost\": \"{2}{R}{R}\",\n  \"rule_text\": \"As an additional cost to cast this spell, sacrifice a land.\\nMana-Core Eruption deals 4 damage to each creature and each planeswalker.\\nAdd {R}{R} to your mana pool.\",\n  \"rarity\": \"Rare\"\n}\n```\n\nPrevious Step 'design_set_mechanics':\nHere is the mechanical framework for your Magic: The Gathering set, \"The Vela Archipelago\":\n\n---\n\n## 1.
