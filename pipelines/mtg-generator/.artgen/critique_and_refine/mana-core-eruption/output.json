  "prompt": "Background Context:\nProject Context:\n- set_theme: A vibrant cosmic voyage set blending Polynesian wayfinding culture with interstellar exploration.\n\nThe Vela Archipelago - scattered island-worlds across a nebula-sea where ancient wayfinders navigate \nusing both star charts and ancestral spirits. Their great canoe-ships ride cosmic currents between \nworlds, powered by mana drawn from volcanic cores and celestial convergences.\n\nKey themes:\n- Wayfinding: Navigation using stars, currents, and spirit guides across both ocean and space\n- Ancestor spirits: Departed navigators whose spirits guide the living through dangerous passages\n- Mana as fuel: Volcanic/stellar energy that powers both magic and interstellar travel\n- Tattoo magic (Tatau): Sacred markings that store power, record lineage, and enable abilities\n- The Great Voyage: An ongoing journey to unite scattered island-worlds under one chiefdom\n- Cosmic sea creatures: Massive beings that swim between stars - some helpful guides, others apex predators\n- Coral nebulae: Beautiful but treacherous regions of space filled with life and danger\n\nVisual motifs: Intricate tribal patterns, bioluminescent creatures, volcanic islands floating in starfields,\noutrigger starships with solar sails, warriors with glowing tattoos, coral formations in nebula clouds.\n\n- set_size: 6\n\nCurrent Asset:\n- name: Mana-Core Eruption\n- card_type: Sorcery\n- rarity: Rare\n- color: Red\n- concept: \"Mana-Core Eruption\" represents the catastrophic overload and violent discharge of a volcanic island's mana core, a raw, untamed force unleashed upon the cosmos. This event underscores the volatile nature of mana within the Vela Archipelago, either as a natural cataclysm or a consequence of the Void Blight's corrupting influence or reckless mana extraction. Mechanically, it's a powerful red sorcery that could devastate opponents while providing a temporary, explosive surge of mana, reflecting both the destruction and the raw power released by such an event.\n- mechanics_brainstorm: Here are 10 possible mechanics/abilities for the Magic card \"Mana-Core Eruption\":\n\n1.  Mana-Core Eruption deals 4 damage to target creature or planeswalker. Add {R}{R}{R}{R}. Until end of turn, you don't lose this mana as steps and phases end.\n    *   **Complexity:** 2 (Direct damage combined with a ritual-like temporary mana boost).\n    *   **Flavor:** 5 (Perfectly captures both the \"devastate opponents\" aspect through direct damage and the \"explosive surge of mana\" from the core).\n    *   **Synergy:** 4 (The surge of temporary mana strongly supports Red's Prowess mechanic by enabling more noncreature spells in the same turn, and Landfall if those spells can put lands into play or trigger off them. It's a general powerful red effect.)\n\n2.  Mana-Core Eruption deals 3 damage to each creature. Add {R} for each creature that died this way. Until end of turn, you don't lose this mana as steps and phases end.\n    *   **Complexity:** 3 (Mass removal, followed by a conditional mana generation based on the outcome).\n    *   **Flavor:** 5 (Represents the catastrophic overload causing destruction, and then harnessing the raw energy released from the devastation to fuel further actions).\n    *   **Synergy:** 4 (Supports Red's board control, enabling you to clear threats and then use the generated mana for follow-up aggressive plays, including crewing Vehicles or casting Prowess enablers).\n\n3.  Mana-Core Eruption deals 3 damage to target creature or planeswalker. Add {R}{R}{R}. Then, you may put a land card from your hand onto the battlefield. If you do, Mana-Core Eruption deals 2 damage to each opponent.\n    *   **Complexity:** 3 (Direct damage, mana generation, then an optional land drop with a conditional damage trigger).\n    *   **Flavor:** 5 (The core erupts, releasing mana, and the force of the eruption can cause a new \"island-world\" to stabilize, providing more fuel and a shockwave). Strong connection to volcanic islands and Landfall.\n    *   **Synergy:** 5 (Excellent synergy with the Landfall mechanic, allowing you to trigger it twice in a turn (once for this spell's ability, potentially once more with a different card after using the mana) and leveraging your lands for value).\n\n4.  As an additional cost to cast this spell, discard a card or sacrifice a land. Mana-Core Eruption deals 5 damage to target opponent or planeswalker. Add {R}{R}{R}{R}{R}. Until end of turn, you don't lose this mana as steps and phases end.\n    *   **Complexity:** 3 (Includes an additional cost, a powerful damage effect, and a large temporary mana burst).\n    *   **Flavor:** 5 (The \"untamed force\" requires a cost, pushing the core to its limits for a devastating and mana-rich discharge. Fits the volatile nature).\n    *   **Synergy:** 4 (The substantial mana burst directly supports chaining multiple spells, which can fuel Prowess creatures. Sacrificing a land could synergize with certain Black/Red graveyard strategies or Landfall-triggered \"death\" effects).\n\n5.  Flip a coin. If you lose the flip, Mana-Core Eruption deals 4 damage to you. If you win the flip, add {R}{R}{R}{R}{R}. Then, Mana-Core Eruption deals 3 damage to each creature.\n    *   **Complexity:** 4 (Introduces a coin flip with conditional personal downside/upside, followed by a guaranteed mass damage effect).\n    *   **Flavor:** 5 (Embodies the \"raw, untamed force\" and \"volatile nature\" of the mana core, with unpredictable and potentially dangerous outcomes).\n    *   **Synergy:** 3 (While fitting Red's chaotic nature, the randomness offers less direct mechanical synergy with the set's established mechanics, though the mass damage and potential mana are broadly useful).\n\n6.  Mana-Core Eruption deals 3 damage to target creature or planeswalker. Add {R}{R}{R}. Until end of turn, noncreature spells you cast cost {2} less to cast.\n    *   **Complexity:** 3 (Direct damage, mana generation, followed by a cost-reduction effect for subsequent spells).\n    *   **Flavor:** 4 (The \"explosive surge\" of mana supercharges your ability to cast more spells rapidly, reflecting quick, decisive action fueled by the eruption).\n    *   **Synergy:** 5 (Strong synergy with the Prowess mechanic. This card provides mana *and* makes subsequent Prowess-triggering spells cheaper, enabling powerful chains of spells in a single turn for UR/WR archetypes).\n\n7.  As an additional cost to cast this spell, sacrifice a land. Mana-Core Eruption deals 4 damage to each creature. Search your library for an instant or sorcery card, reveal it, put it into your hand, then shuffle. Add {R}{R}.\n    *   **Complexity:** 4 (Additional cost, mass damage, a tutor effect, and some mana generation).\n    *   **Flavor:** 5 (A catastrophic discharge that devastates the immediate area but reveals deep, underlying power or knowledge, allowing you to find the exact spell needed in the aftermath).\n    *   **Synergy:** 4 (The mass damage supports Red's aggressive tendencies. The tutor effect allows you to find key Prowess enablers or powerful removal/burn, and sacrificing a land plays into Landfall-adjacent themes of lands being resources).\n\n8.  Mana-Core Eruption deals 3 damage to each creature. Until end of turn, the next instant or sorcery spell you cast costs {2} less to cast, and you may cast it as though it had Flash.\n    *   **Complexity:** 4 (Mass damage, followed by a conditional cost reduction and granting of Flash for a single subsequent spell).\n    *   **Flavor:** 4 (The eruption creates an immediate opening, allowing for a swift, unexpected follow-up action, like a sudden tactical maneuver or a quick burst of spellcraft).\n    *   **Synergy:** 4 (The cost reduction and Flash ability strongly support Prowess strategies by enabling a fast, cheap follow-up spell, maximizing the damage potential of creatures with Prowess in a single turn).\n\n9.  Mana-Core Eruption deals damage equal to the number of lands you control to target creature or planeswalker. Add {R} for each land that entered the battlefield under your control this turn.\n    *   **Complexity:** 3 (Conditional damage based on current board state, and conditional mana based on recent actions).\n    *   **Flavor:** 5 (The eruption's power is directly tied to the \"volcanic island's mana core\" and its connection to the land, gaining more power from established roots and recent geological activity).\n    *   **Synergy:** 5 (Deep synergy with the Landfall mechanic. The damage scales with your land count, and the mana rewards you for playing lands, perfectly fitting RG/WR archetypes focused on ramping lands and triggering Landfall).\n\n10. Mana-Core Eruption deals 2 damage to each opponent. Until end of turn, creatures you control get +2/+0 and gain haste. Add {R}{R}{R}. Until end of turn, you don't lose this mana as steps and phases end.\n    *   **Complexity:** 3 (Direct damage to opponents, an anthem effect, granting haste, and temporary mana generation).\n    *   **Flavor:** 4 (A sudden, aggressive discharge of energy that supercharges your forces, allowing them to strike immediately and with increased ferocity).\n    *   **Synergy:** 4 (Supports aggressive Red archetypes, particularly those using Vehicles (allowing them to attack immediately) or numerous creatures. The mana can be used to cast more creatures or burn spells post-combat).\n- card_json: ```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"Mana-Core Eruption\",\n  \"supertype\": \"Sorcery\",\n  \"subtype\": \"\",\n  \"mana_cost\": \"{1}{R}{R}\",\n  \"power\": null,\n  \"toughness\": null,\n  \"rule_text\": \"Mana-Core Eruption deals 4 damage to target creature or planeswalker.
