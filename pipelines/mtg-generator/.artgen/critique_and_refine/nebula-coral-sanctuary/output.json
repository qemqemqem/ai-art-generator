  "prompt": "Background Context:\nProject Context:\n- set_theme: A vibrant cosmic voyage set blending Polynesian wayfinding culture with interstellar exploration.\n\nThe Vela Archipelago - scattered island-worlds across a nebula-sea where ancient wayfinders navigate \nusing both star charts and ancestral spirits. Their great canoe-ships ride cosmic currents between \nworlds, powered by mana drawn from volcanic cores and celestial convergences.\n\nKey themes:\n- Wayfinding: Navigation using stars, currents, and spirit guides across both ocean and space\n- Ancestor spirits: Departed navigators whose spirits guide the living through dangerous passages\n- Mana as fuel: Volcanic/stellar energy that powers both magic and interstellar travel\n- Tattoo magic (Tatau): Sacred markings that store power, record lineage, and enable abilities\n- The Great Voyage: An ongoing journey to unite scattered island-worlds under one chiefdom\n- Cosmic sea creatures: Massive beings that swim between stars - some helpful guides, others apex predators\n- Coral nebulae: Beautiful but treacherous regions of space filled with life and danger\n\nVisual motifs: Intricate tribal patterns, bioluminescent creatures, volcanic islands floating in starfields,\noutrigger starships with solar sails, warriors with glowing tattoos, coral formations in nebula clouds.\n\n- set_size: 6\n\nCurrent Asset:\n- name: Nebula Coral Sanctuary\n- card_type: Enchantment\n- rarity: Uncommon\n- color: Green\n- concept: This enchantment represents a verdant, mana-rich expanse within the Living Reef of Lumina, a haven where life flourishes untouched by the Void Blight. It symbolizes a crucial Wayfinder sanctuary, providing vital cosmic mana and guiding spirits to those who seek refuge and resilience against the encroaching darkness. Mechanically, it could consistently generate mana or allow players to 'scry' for their next path, reflecting its role as a source of power and celestial navigation.\n- mechanics_brainstorm: Here are 10 possible mechanics for \"Nebula Coral Sanctuary\":\n\n1.  Whenever a land enters the battlefield under your control, you may add {G}. If you do, scry 1.\n    *   Complexity 3. Triggered ability with a conditional choice and two effects.\n    *   Flavor 5. Directly represents the \"mana-rich expanse\" and \"guiding spirits\" through \"scry for your next path,\" tying into the \"Coral Nebulae\" theme via Landfall.\n    *   Synergy 5. Combines the primary Green mechanic Landfall with the set's core Scry mechanic and mana generation, fitting Green's role perfectly.\n\n2.  At the beginning of your upkeep, scry 1.\n    Creatures you control with a +1/+1 counter on them have vigilance.\n    *   Complexity 4. Upkeep triggered ability and a conditional static ability.\n    *   Flavor 4. \"Guiding spirits\" for consistent navigation (Scry) and \"life flourishes untouched\" (vigilance for resilient, growing creatures).\n    *   Synergy 4. Supports the set's Scry mechanic and synergizes with +1/+1 counters, which are central to the Tatau mechanic and Green's growth theme.\n\n3.  Whenever a creature you control explores, put a +1/+1 counter on it and scry 1.\n    *   Complexity 3. Triggered ability with two effects.\n    *   Flavor 5. A sanctuary should greatly aid \"Wayfinders\" and their \"Great Voyage\" by enhancing their \"Explore\" actions, leading to growth and foresight.\n    *   Synergy 5. Directly enhances two of Green's primary mechanics, Explore and Tatau (+1/+1 counters), while also leveraging Scry for Wayfinding.\n\n4.  {T}: Add {G}.\n    Creatures you control with mana value 3 or less have hexproof.\n    *   Complexity 4. Activated mana ability and a static ability with a condition.\n    *   Flavor 4. \"Providing vital cosmic mana\" and acting as a \"haven where life flourishes untouched by the Void Blight\" by protecting smaller creatures.\n    *   Synergy 3. Provides direct mana and resilience, which is a general Green theme, though hexproof isn't a specific set mechanic.\n\n5.  Lands you control have \"{T}: Add {G}\" in addition to their other abilities.\n    At the beginning of your end step, if a land entered the battlefield under your control this turn, scry 1.\n    *   Complexity 4. Static ability altering lands and a conditional end-step triggered ability.\n    *   Flavor 5. Captures the \"mana-rich expanse\" (all lands tap for green) and the \"guiding spirits\" (scrying after a new discovery/growth).\n    *   Synergy 5. Excellent synergy with Landfall, mana ramp, and Scry, reinforcing Green's themes of growth and wayfinding.\n\n6.  Whenever a land enters the battlefield under your control, you gain 1 life and put a +1/+1 counter on target creature you control.\n    *   Complexity 3. Triggered ability with two effects.\n    *   Flavor 4. Represents \"life flourishes\" and the \"verdant, mana-rich expanse\" providing both sustenance (life) and growth.\n    *   Synergy 4. Strong synergy with Landfall and +1/+1 counters (Tatau), both primary Green mechanics.\n\n7.  Whenever one or more creatures you control attack, you may scry 1. If you do, you may add {G}.\n    *   Complexity 3. Triggered ability with a conditional choice and an optional effect.\n    *   Flavor 3. The \"sanctuary\" provides guidance and \"mana as fuel\" for \"The Great Voyage\" (attacking creatures).\n    *   Synergy 3. Leverages Scry and provides mana, fitting the Wayfinding and Mana as Fuel themes, though less directly tied to Green's primary mechanics.\n\n8.  Wayfinder creatures you control get +1/+1.\n    Whenever a Wayfinder creature you control attacks, scry 1.\n    *   Complexity 3. Static ability and a triggered ability.\n    *   Flavor 5. Directly supports the \"Wayfinder sanctuary\" concept, enhancing these crucial creatures and providing them with navigation (scry).\n    *   Synergy 4. Enhances a key creature type of the set and provides consistent Scry for wayfinding.\n\n9.  At the beginning of your end step, if you cast a spell from your graveyard this turn, scry 2.\n    {T}: Add {G}.\n    *   Complexity 4. Conditional end-step triggered ability and an activated mana ability.\n    *   Flavor 4. \"Vital cosmic mana\" (T) and \"ancestor spirits\" (Flashback spells) providing enhanced guidance (Scry 2) when their wisdom is called upon.\n    *   Synergy 4. Combines mana generation with Scry, and rewards engagement with the Flashback mechanic, which is secondary for Green.\n\n10. Whenever you cast a creature spell, put a +1/+1 counter on it.\n    {1}{G}, {T}: Scry 2.\n    *   Complexity 4. Triggered ability and an activated ability with a cost.\n    *   Flavor 4. \"Life flourishes\" (creature growth/Tatau) and \"scry for your next path\" (wayfinding, guidance).\n    *   Synergy 4. Supports Green's creature focus and +1/+1 counter theme (Tatau), while also providing a reliable way to Scry.\n- card_json: ```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"Nebula Coral Sanctuary\",\n  \"supertype\": \"Enchantment\",\n  \"subtype\": \"\",\n  \"mana_cost\": \"{2}{G}\",\n  \"power\": null,\n  \"toughness\": null,\n  \"rule_text\": \"Whenever a land enters the battlefield under your control, you may add {G}.
