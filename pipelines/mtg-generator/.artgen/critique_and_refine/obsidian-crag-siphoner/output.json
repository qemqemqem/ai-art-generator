  "prompt": "Background Context:\nProject Context:\n- set_theme: A vibrant cosmic voyage set blending Polynesian wayfinding culture with interstellar exploration.\n\nThe Vela Archipelago - scattered island-worlds across a nebula-sea where ancient wayfinders navigate \nusing both star charts and ancestral spirits. Their great canoe-ships ride cosmic currents between \nworlds, powered by mana drawn from volcanic cores and celestial convergences.\n\nKey themes:\n- Wayfinding: Navigation using stars, currents, and spirit guides across both ocean and space\n- Ancestor spirits: Departed navigators whose spirits guide the living through dangerous passages\n- Mana as fuel: Volcanic/stellar energy that powers both magic and interstellar travel\n- Tattoo magic (Tatau): Sacred markings that store power, record lineage, and enable abilities\n- The Great Voyage: An ongoing journey to unite scattered island-worlds under one chiefdom\n- Cosmic sea creatures: Massive beings that swim between stars - some helpful guides, others apex predators\n- Coral nebulae: Beautiful but treacherous regions of space filled with life and danger\n\nVisual motifs: Intricate tribal patterns, bioluminescent creatures, volcanic islands floating in starfields,\noutrigger starships with solar sails, warriors with glowing tattoos, coral formations in nebula clouds.\n\n- set_size: 6\n\nCurrent Asset:\n- name: Obsidian Crag Siphoner\n- card_type: Creature - Human Shaman\n- rarity: Common\n- color: Black\n- concept: Obsidian Crag Siphoners are the black mana shamans serving High Priestess Xylara, whose dark rituals empower the Void Blight by relentlessly draining mana from volcanic island-worlds. They are foot soldiers of corruption, weakening the archipelago's lifeblood to fuel Xylara's destructive cause. Mechanically, they could embody this by allowing players to sacrifice permanents or pay life to generate black mana or other detrimental effects.\n- mechanics_brainstorm: Here are 10 possible mechanics for Obsidian Crag Siphoner:\n\n1.  **{T}, Sacrifice another creature: Add {B}.**\n    *   Complexity 2. Flavor 5 (Directly siphoning the \"lifeblood\" of other creatures for dark mana). Synergy 5 (Fits Black's sacrifice theme and \"Mana as Fuel\").\n2.  **When Obsidian Crag Siphoner enters the battlefield, target opponent loses 1 life and you gain 1 life.**\n    *   Complexity 2. Flavor 4 (Siphoning life from opponents to empower oneself). Synergy 3 (A simple Black life-drain effect, represents minor corruption spreading).\n3.  **Tatau 1 (When Obsidian Crag Siphoner enters the battlefield, put a +1/+1 counter on it. As long as it has one or more +1/+1 counters on it, it has \"{T}: Pay 1 life: Add {B}.\")**\n    *   Complexity 3. Flavor 5 (Represents a corrupting tattoo that allows the shamen to draw taboo mana from their own life force). Synergy 5 (Directly uses the set's signature mechanic, fits Black's themes of life payment and mana generation).\n4.  **{1}{B}, {T}, Sacrifice another creature: Target creature gets -1/-1 until end of turn.**\n    *   Complexity 3. Flavor 5 (Using the sacrifice of a creature to weaken an opponent, embodying \"weakening the archipelago's lifeblood\"). Synergy 4 (Black's sacrifice-for-removal strategy).\n5.  **Whenever you sacrifice another permanent, you may pay {B}. If you do, draw a card.**\n    *   Complexity 3. Flavor 4 (Gaining dark knowledge or insights from destructive rituals). Synergy 4 (Encourages sacrifice, fitting for Black, provides value for a common cost).\n6.  **{T}: Add {B}. If you control a Mountain, you lose 1 life.**\n    *   Complexity 2. Flavor 4 (Draining mana directly from a \"volcanic island-world\" (Mountain) with a detrimental side effect, fitting \"mana as fuel\" with a cost). Synergy 3 (Connects to specific land types without being overly complex).\n7.  **When Obsidian Crag Siphoner enters the battlefield, put the top two cards of your library into your graveyard.**\n    *   Complexity 2. Flavor 3 (Unearthing forbidden secrets or delving into the depths of corrupting mana). Synergy 4 (Feeds the graveyard for \"Flashback\" and other Black graveyard interactions).\n8.  **Obsidian Crag Siphoner has menace as long as you control a creature card in your graveyard.**\n    *   Complexity 2. Flavor 3 (The lingering threat of past sacrifices or ancestral spirits giving it power). Synergy 4 (Simple graveyard interaction, common way for Black to gain evasion).\n9.  **{1}, Sacrifice a land: Add {B}. Activate only once each turn.**\n    *   Complexity 3. Flavor 5 (A measured, relentless draining of \"volcanic island-worlds\" to fuel rituals). Synergy 5 (Directly fits \"draining mana from volcanic island-worlds\" and \"mana as fuel,\" with a sensible restriction for common rarity).\n10. **Whenever another creature you control dies, you may pay 1 life. If you do, put a +1/+1 counter on Obsidian Crag Siphoner.**\n    *   Complexity 3. Flavor 4 (The Siphoner grows in power by feeding on the essence of fallen allies, a darker form of \"lifeblood\" extraction). Synergy 4 (Works well with sacrifice strategies and enhances the creature, potentially synergizing with Tatau).\n- card_json: ```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"Obsidian Crag Siphoner\",\n  \"supertype\": \"Creature\",\n  \"subtype\": \"Human Shaman\",\n  \"mana_cost\": \"{1}{B}\",\n  \"power\": \"1\",\n  \"toughness\": \"1\",\n  \"rule_text\": \"Tatau 1 (When Obsidian Crag Siphoner enters the battlefield, put a +1/+1 counter on it.
