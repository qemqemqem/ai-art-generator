  "prompt": "Background Context:\nProject Context:\n- set_theme: A vibrant cosmic voyage set blending Polynesian wayfinding culture with interstellar exploration.\n\nThe Vela Archipelago - scattered island-worlds across a nebula-sea where ancient wayfinders navigate \nusing both star charts and ancestral spirits. Their great canoe-ships ride cosmic currents between \nworlds, powered by mana drawn from volcanic cores and celestial convergences.\n\nKey themes:\n- Wayfinding: Navigation using stars, currents, and spirit guides across both ocean and space\n- Ancestor spirits: Departed navigators whose spirits guide the living through dangerous passages\n- Mana as fuel: Volcanic/stellar energy that powers both magic and interstellar travel\n- Tattoo magic (Tatau): Sacred markings that store power, record lineage, and enable abilities\n- The Great Voyage: An ongoing journey to unite scattered island-worlds under one chiefdom\n- Cosmic sea creatures: Massive beings that swim between stars - some helpful guides, others apex predators\n- Coral nebulae: Beautiful but treacherous regions of space filled with life and danger\n\nVisual motifs: Intricate tribal patterns, bioluminescent creatures, volcanic islands floating in starfields,\noutrigger starships with solar sails, warriors with glowing tattoos, coral formations in nebula clouds.\n\n- set_size: 6\n\nCurrent Asset:\n- name: Obsidian Crag Siphoner\n- card_type: Creature - Human Shaman\n- rarity: Common\n- color: Black\n- concept: This Human Shaman is a loyal servant of High Priestess Xylara, trained to forcefully extract and corrupt mana from the land, particularly from the scarred core of the Obsidian Crag. They fuel Xylara's dark rituals and the spread of the Void Blight, offering players a way to convert their own resources into a surge of black mana, albeit through a dark bargain.\n- mechanics_brainstorm: Here are 10 possible mechanics/abilities for the \"Obsidian Crag Siphoner\" card, designed to fit its concept, rarity, and the set's themes:\n\n1.  **{T}: Add {B}. You lose 1 life.**\n    *   Complexity 1.\n    *   Flavor 5. (Directly represents the \"dark bargain\" for mana and the corrupting nature of the siphoning.)\n    *   Synergy 4. (Simple black mana acceleration that fits the color's theme of power at a cost.)\n\n2.  **{T}, Sacrifice a land: Add {B}{B}.**\n    *   Complexity 2.\n    *   Flavor 5. (Clearly depicts \"forcefully extracting and corrupting mana from the land,\" with the land sacrifice as the ultimate \"dark bargain.\")\n    *   Synergy 5. (Strongly supports Black's resource manipulation and sacrifice themes, aligning with the \"scarred core of the Obsidian Crag.\")\n\n3.  **{T}, Sacrifice another creature: Add {B}{B}.**\n    *   Complexity 2.\n    *   Flavor 4. (Represents \"fueling Xylara's dark rituals\" through creature sacrifice, a common black theme. Less about \"land\" directly, but still a dark resource conversion.)\n    *   Synergy 5. (Excellent for Black's creature sacrifice archetypes, giving a powerful mana burst.)\n\n4.  **{T}, Exile a card from your graveyard: Add {B}.**\n    *   Complexity 2.\n    *   Flavor 4. (Implies siphoning power or lingering essence from the departed, fitting a \"dark bargain\" from an unconventional resource.)\n    *   Synergy 5. (Supports Black's graveyard interaction themes, making use of otherwise spent resources.)\n\n5.  **{1}, Pay 2 life: Add {B}.**\n    *   Complexity 2.\n    *   Flavor 5. (A straightforward \"dark bargain\" to generate black mana, directly exchanging life for power.)\n    *   Synergy 4. (Provides another flexible way to get black mana at a cost, not reliant on tapping.)\n\n6.  **When Obsidian Crag Siphoner enters the battlefield, you lose 1 life and add {B}.**\n    *   Complexity 2.\n    *   Flavor 5. (An immediate, one-shot \"surge of black mana\" coupled with the unavoidable \"dark bargain\" of life loss.)\n    *   Synergy 4. (Good for aggressive black decks that want an immediate mana boost for a small cost.)\n\n7.  **{T}: Add {B}. Put a -1/-1 counter on target creature you control.**\n    *   Complexity 3.\n    *   Flavor 5. (Captures both the mana generation and the \"spread of the Void Blight\" by corrupting a creature under your control as the \"dark bargain.\")\n    *   Synergy 5. (Works with Black's themes of weakening creatures and utilizing drawbacks for power, potentially setting up sacrifice synergies.)\n\n8.  **Tatau 1 (When this creature enters the battlefield, put a +1/+1 counter on it. As long as it has one or more +1/+1 counters on it, it has \"{T}: Add {B}. You lose 1 life.\")**\n    *   Complexity 4.\n    *   Flavor 5. (The \"Tatau\" represents the shaman's growing power/corruption, which then enables the siphoning ability, fitting the \"stored power\" of tattoos and the \"dark bargain\" of mana.)\n    *   Synergy 5. (Integrates the set's signature \"Tatau\" mechanic with the card's core concept and Black's thematic costs.)\n\n9.  **Whenever a creature you control dies, you may pay 1 life. If you do, add {B}.**\n    *   Complexity 3.\n    *   Flavor 4. (Connects to \"fueling dark rituals\" by leveraging the death of creatures and adding a \"dark bargain\" of life for mana.)\n    *   Synergy 5. (Highly synergistic with Black's sacrifice strategies, turning creature deaths into mana acceleration.)\n\n10. **At the beginning of your upkeep, you may sacrifice a land. If you do, add {B}.**\n    *   Complexity 3.\n    *   Flavor 5. (A recurring \"forceful extraction of mana from the land,\" representing an ongoing \"siphoning\" process from the Obsidian Crag, with the land sacrifice as the ongoing cost.)\n    *   Synergy 4. (Provides consistent mana generation for Black, fitting into strategies that can afford to sacrifice lands or benefit from lands entering the graveyard.)\n- card_json: ```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"Obsidian Crag Siphoner\",\n  \"supertype\": \"Creature\",\n  \"subtype\": \"Human Shaman\",\n  \"mana_cost\": \"{1}{B}\",\n  \"power\": \"1\",\n  \"toughness\": \"1\",\n  \"rule_text\": \"Tatau 1 (When this creature enters the battlefield, put a +1/+1 counter on it.
