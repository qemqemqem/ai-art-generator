  "prompt": "Background Context:\nProject Context:\n- set_theme: A vibrant cosmic voyage set blending Polynesian wayfinding culture with interstellar exploration.\n\nThe Vela Archipelago - scattered island-worlds across a nebula-sea where ancient wayfinders navigate \nusing both star charts and ancestral spirits. Their great canoe-ships ride cosmic currents between \nworlds, powered by mana drawn from volcanic cores and celestial convergences.\n\nKey themes:\n- Wayfinding: Navigation using stars, currents, and spirit guides across both ocean and space\n- Ancestor spirits: Departed navigators whose spirits guide the living through dangerous passages\n- Mana as fuel: Volcanic/stellar energy that powers both magic and interstellar travel\n- Tattoo magic (Tatau): Sacred markings that store power, record lineage, and enable abilities\n- The Great Voyage: An ongoing journey to unite scattered island-worlds under one chiefdom\n- Cosmic sea creatures: Massive beings that swim between stars - some helpful guides, others apex predators\n- Coral nebulae: Beautiful but treacherous regions of space filled with life and danger\n\nVisual motifs: Intricate tribal patterns, bioluminescent creatures, volcanic islands floating in starfields,\noutrigger starships with solar sails, warriors with glowing tattoos, coral formations in nebula clouds.\n\n- set_size: 6\n\nCurrent Asset:\n- name: Obsidian Crag Siphoner\n- card_type: Creature - Human Shaman\n- rarity: Common\n- color: Black\n- concept: These grim shamans are agents of High Priestess Xylara, tasked with draining corrupted mana from the Obsidian Crag and other dwindling island-worlds to fuel the Void Blight. They represent the pervasive corruption of mana across the archipelago, empowering Xylara's faction at the cost of the land's life force. Mechanically, they could either offer a repeatable resource drain against an opponent, or allow players to convert their own creatures into dark mana, embodying the faction's ruthless ambition.\n- mechanics_brainstorm: Here are 10 possible mechanics for Obsidian Crag Siphoner, adhering to the specified format and constraints:\n\n1.  **Tap, Sacrifice another creature: Add (B).**\n    *   Complexity: 2\n    *   Flavor: 5 (Directly represents converting other creatures' life force into dark mana for Xylara's faction.)\n    *   Synergy: 5 (Excellent for fueling black spells, heavily supports sacrifice-based archetypes like BR and BG, aligning with the \"convert own creatures into dark mana\" concept.)\n\n2.  **Tap, Sacrifice a land: Target opponent loses 2 life.**\n    *   Complexity: 3\n    *   Flavor: 5 (Perfectly embodies draining corrupted mana from \"dwindling island-worlds\" and turning it into a harmful effect for an opponent.)\n    *   Synergy: 4 (Connects to black's willingness to sacrifice lands for value, provides repeatable resource drain, fitting for aggressive BR strategies.)\n\n3.  **Tap, Sacrifice another creature: Each opponent loses 1 life.**\n    *   Complexity: 2\n    *   Flavor: 4 (Siphoning the vitality from sacrificed creatures to directly harm opponents.)\n    *   Synergy: 4 (Good for sacrifice themes, provides consistent attrition, useful in BR aggressive or WB grindy archetypes.)\n\n4.  **Tap, Sacrifice another creature: Put a +1/+1 counter on Obsidian Crag Siphoner.**\n    *   Complexity: 2\n    *   Flavor: 4 (Represents the Siphoner growing stronger and more corrupted by consuming the life force of others, a twisted form of power gain.)\n    *   Synergy: 4 (Encourages sacrifice, synergizes with +1/+1 counter strategies in BG, allowing the Siphoner to become a threat.)\n\n5.  **Tap, Exile a creature card from your graveyard: Target opponent loses 1 life.**\n    *   Complexity: 3\n    *   Flavor: 4 (Utilizing the 'corrupted remnants' of fallen creatures to empower the Siphoner's draining effect, fitting the taboo mana concept.)\n    *   Synergy: 4 (Excellent for graveyard-matters archetypes (WB, UB, BG) by giving value to creatures in the graveyard while providing repeatable resource drain.)\n\n6.  **Tap: Target land an opponent controls doesn't untap during its controller's next untap step.**\n    *   Complexity: 3\n    *   Flavor: 4 (Directly illustrates \"draining\" mana from an opponent's land, preventing it from producing resources, making it a \"dwindling island-world\" temporarily.)\n    *   Synergy: 3 (Provides resource denial, fitting for control-oriented strategies like UB, and can disrupt opponent's mana curve.)\n\n7.  **When Obsidian Crag Siphoner enters the battlefield, you may sacrifice a land. If you do, draw a card.**\n    *   Complexity: 3\n    *   Flavor: 3 (Represents a ruthless exchange of a land's potential for immediate knowledge or a new resource, rather than a direct drain of corrupted mana.)\n    *   Synergy: 3 (Provides an immediate value play upon entering, encourages land sacrifice which can fuel other mechanics like Landfall or graveyard synergies.)\n\n8.  **Tap: Target creature gets -1/-1 until end of turn.**\n    *   Complexity: 2\n    *   Flavor: 4 (A straightforward representation of \"draining\" the vitality or power from an opponent's creature, weakening it.)\n    *   Synergy: 3 (Basic black removal/weakening, useful in various archetypes for board control or to finish off damaged creatures.)\n\n9.  **Tap, Sacrifice another creature: Create a 1/1 black Spirit creature token.**\n    *   Complexity: 3\n    *   Flavor: 4 (Sacrificing a living creature's essence to manifest a lesser, perhaps corrupted, spirit. This twists the ancestor spirit theme into something more sinister.)\n    *   Synergy: 4 (Excellent for sacrifice-heavy strategies (BR, BG), allowing players to go wide or provide fodder for other effects while embodying creature conversion.)\n\n10. **Whenever you sacrifice another creature, put a +1/+1 counter on Obsidian Crag Siphoner.**\n    *   Complexity: 2\n    *   Flavor: 4 (Continuously growing stronger and more imposing as it oversees the consumption of other creatures, a constant, dark manifestation of power accumulation.)\n    *   Synergy: 5 (Strong synergy with any sacrifice strategy, making the Siphoner a progressively larger threat and aligning with the 'fueling Xylara's faction' aspect by empowering her agents.)\n- card_json: ```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"Obsidian Crag Siphoner\",\n  \"supertype\": \"Creature\",\n  \"subtype\": \"Human Shaman\",\n  \"mana_cost\": \"{1}{B}\",\n  \"power\": \"1\",\n  \"toughness\": \"2\",\n  \"rule_text\": \"{T}, Sacrifice a land: Target opponent loses 2 life.\",\n  \"rarity\": \"Common\"\n}\n```\n\nPrevious Step 'design_set_mechanics':\nHere is the mechanical framework for your Magic: The Gathering set, \"The Vela Archipelago\":\n\n---\n\n## 1.
