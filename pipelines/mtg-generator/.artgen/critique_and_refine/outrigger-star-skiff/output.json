  "prompt": "Background Context:\nProject Context:\n- set_theme: A vibrant cosmic voyage set blending Polynesian wayfinding culture with interstellar exploration.\n\nThe Vela Archipelago - scattered island-worlds across a nebula-sea where ancient wayfinders navigate \nusing both star charts and ancestral spirits. Their great canoe-ships ride cosmic currents between \nworlds, powered by mana drawn from volcanic cores and celestial convergences.\n\nKey themes:\n- Wayfinding: Navigation using stars, currents, and spirit guides across both ocean and space\n- Ancestor spirits: Departed navigators whose spirits guide the living through dangerous passages\n- Mana as fuel: Volcanic/stellar energy that powers both magic and interstellar travel\n- Tattoo magic (Tatau): Sacred markings that store power, record lineage, and enable abilities\n- The Great Voyage: An ongoing journey to unite scattered island-worlds under one chiefdom\n- Cosmic sea creatures: Massive beings that swim between stars - some helpful guides, others apex predators\n- Coral nebulae: Beautiful but treacherous regions of space filled with life and danger\n\nVisual motifs: Intricate tribal patterns, bioluminescent creatures, volcanic islands floating in starfields,\noutrigger starships with solar sails, warriors with glowing tattoos, coral formations in nebula clouds.\n\n- set_size: 6\n\nCurrent Asset:\n- name: Outrigger Star-Skiff\n- card_type: Artifact - Vehicle\n- rarity: Common\n- color: Colorless\n- concept: This nimble outrigger star-skiff is a ubiquitous sight in the Vela Archipelago, representing the Wayfinders' most common vessel for navigating the cosmic currents between island-worlds. It's the workhorse of the fleet, vital for scouting and maintaining communication, embodying the core theme of efficient Wayfinding even for the humblest explorer. Mechanically, it offers a reliable, low-cost way to get your creatures \"sailing\" across the starlit sea, enabling early board presence and thematic \"exploration.\"\n- mechanics_brainstorm: Here are 10 possible mechanics/abilities for the \"Outrigger Star-Skiff\" card, designed to fit its concept, rarity, and the set's themes and mechanics:\n\n1.  **Whenever you crew Outrigger Star-Skiff, scry 1.**\n    *   Complexity 2.\n    *   Flavor 5 (Directly represents scouting and Wayfinding, charting a course).\n    *   Synergy 5 (Utilizes Scry, a core set mechanic, supporting WU/UG/UR archetypes).\n\n2.  **Whenever you crew Outrigger Star-Skiff, explore.**\n    *   Complexity 3.\n    *   Flavor 5 (Directly represents exploration and discovery of new paths or knowledge).\n    *   Synergy 5 (Utilizes Explore, a core set mechanic, supporting WG/BG/UG archetypes).\n\n3.  **Flying**\n    *   Complexity 1.\n    *   Flavor 4 (A nimble star-skiff sailing through cosmic currents, evading obstacles).\n    *   Synergy 4 (Provides evasion, fitting for a 'star-skiff' and beneficial for aggressive WU/WR archetypes).\n\n4.  **Skulk (This creature can't be blocked by creatures with greater power.)**\n    *   Complexity 1.\n    *   Flavor 4 (Represents the skiff's nimbleness and ability to slip past larger, slower cosmic threats).\n    *   Synergy 3 (Provides evasion, fitting for blue's cunning maneuvers).\n\n5.  **Whenever you cast a noncreature spell, if Outrigger Star-Skiff is a creature, it gets +1/+1 until end of turn.**\n    *   Complexity 2.\n    *   Flavor 4 (Represents quick, nimble maneuvers or a surge of mana from a spell to gain speed/power).\n    *   Synergy 4 (Utilizes Prowess, a core set mechanic, supporting UR archetypes).\n\n6.  **{T}: Add {C}. Activate only if Outrigger Star-Skiff isn't a creature.**\n    *   Complexity 2.\n    *   Flavor 4 (The skiff can siphon mana from its core or sails when not actively being used for travel, representing \"Mana as Fuel\").\n    *   Synergy 3 (Provides colorless mana utility, fits with resource generation).\n\n7.  **Whenever a land enters the battlefield under your control, if Outrigger Star-Skiff is a creature, it gets +1/+0 until end of turn.**\n    *   Complexity 2.\n    *   Flavor 4 (The discovery of new 'island-worlds' or rich mana regions energizes the skiff's journey).\n    *   Synergy 4 (Utilizes Landfall, a core set mechanic, supporting RG/WG archetypes).\n\n8.  **When Outrigger Star-Skiff enters the battlefield, scry 1.**\n    *   Complexity 2.\n    *   Flavor 3 (Represents an initial charting or reconnaissance upon deploying the skiff).\n    *   Synergy 4 (Utilizes Scry, fits early game utility for Wayfinding).\n\n9.  **Whenever you crew Outrigger Star-Skiff, target creature that crewed it gains vigilance until end of turn.**\n    *   Complexity 2.\n    *   Flavor 3 (The skiff provides a stable platform, allowing the Wayfinder to remain vigilant even after undertaking a journey).\n    *   Synergy 3 (Supports White's defensive strategies and encourages crewing with smaller creatures).\n\n10. **If a Wayfinder creature you control crews Outrigger Star-Skiff, that creature gets +1/+0 until end of turn.**\n    *   Complexity 2.\n    *   Flavor 4 (Expert Wayfinders can get more out of their skiffs, gaining confidence or a burst of speed).\n    *   Synergy 4 (Encourages Wayfinder tribal synergy, a key creature type in the set, and links to the crew mechanic).\n- card_json: ```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"Outrigger Star-Skiff\",\n  \"supertype\": \"Artifact\",\n  \"subtype\": \"Vehicle\",\n  \"mana_cost\": \"{2}\",\n  \"power\": \"2\",\n  \"toughness\": \"1\",\n  \"rule_text\": \"Flying\\nWhenever you crew Outrigger Star-Skiff, scry 1.\\nCrew 1 *(Tap any number of creatures you control with total power 1 or more: This permanent becomes an artifact creature until end of turn.)*\",\n  \"rarity\": \"Common\"\n}\n```\n\nPrevious Step 'design_set_mechanics':\nHere is the mechanical framework for your Magic: The Gathering set, \"The Vela Archipelago\":\n\n---\n\n## 1.
