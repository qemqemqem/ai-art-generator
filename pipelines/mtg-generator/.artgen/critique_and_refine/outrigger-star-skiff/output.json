  "prompt": "Background Context:\nProject Context:\n- set_theme: A vibrant cosmic voyage set blending Polynesian wayfinding culture with interstellar exploration.\n\nThe Vela Archipelago - scattered island-worlds across a nebula-sea where ancient wayfinders navigate \nusing both star charts and ancestral spirits. Their great canoe-ships ride cosmic currents between \nworlds, powered by mana drawn from volcanic cores and celestial convergences.\n\nKey themes:\n- Wayfinding: Navigation using stars, currents, and spirit guides across both ocean and space\n- Ancestor spirits: Departed navigators whose spirits guide the living through dangerous passages\n- Mana as fuel: Volcanic/stellar energy that powers both magic and interstellar travel\n- Tattoo magic (Tatau): Sacred markings that store power, record lineage, and enable abilities\n- The Great Voyage: An ongoing journey to unite scattered island-worlds under one chiefdom\n- Cosmic sea creatures: Massive beings that swim between stars - some helpful guides, others apex predators\n- Coral nebulae: Beautiful but treacherous regions of space filled with life and danger\n\nVisual motifs: Intricate tribal patterns, bioluminescent creatures, volcanic islands floating in starfields,\noutrigger starships with solar sails, warriors with glowing tattoos, coral formations in nebula clouds.\n\n- set_size: 6\n\nCurrent Asset:\n- name: Outrigger Star-Skiff\n- card_type: Artifact - Vehicle\n- rarity: Common\n- color: Colorless\n- concept: This nimble star-skiff is a ubiquitous sight across the nebula-sea, serving as the workhorse for Wayfinders on scouting missions and inter-island transit. Powered by smaller mana cells and guided by ancestral wisdom, it allows individual navigators to brave the cosmic currents and explore nearby space. As a common vehicle, it provides an accessible way to turn a creature into an attacker, perhaps even offering a small Scry effect upon crewing to reflect its Wayfinding purpose.\n- mechanics_brainstorm: Here are 10 possible mechanics/abilities for the \"Outrigger Star-Skiff\" card, designed for common rarity within \"The Vela Archipelago\" set:\n\n1.  **Outrigger Star-Skiff** {2}\n    Artifact - Vehicle\n    2/2\n    Crew 1\n    When you crew Outrigger Star-Skiff, Scry 1.\n    Complexity 3. Flavor 5. Synergy 5.\n    *(This option directly integrates the concept's suggestion for a Scry effect upon crewing, making it a reliable wayfinding tool.)*\n\n2.  **Outrigger Star-Skiff** {3}\n    Artifact - Vehicle\n    Flying\n    2/2\n    Crew 1\n    When you crew Outrigger Star-Skiff, Scry 1.\n    Complexity 4. Flavor 5. Synergy 5.\n    *(Combines Wayfinding (Scry) with the nimble, space-faring nature of a star-skiff (Flying), offering evasive attacks.)*\n\n3.  **Outrigger Star-Skiff** {3}\n    Artifact - Vehicle\n    2/2\n    Crew 1\n    When you crew Outrigger Star-Skiff, Explore.\n    Complexity 4. Flavor 5. Synergy 5.\n    *(Replaces Scry with Explore, another core Wayfinding mechanic, emphasizing the discovery and journey aspect of the skiff.)*\n\n4.  **Outrigger Star-Skiff** {3}\n    Artifact - Vehicle\n    2/2\n    Crew 2\n    When you crew Outrigger Star-Skiff, Scry 1. It gains first strike until end of turn.\n    Complexity 4. Flavor 4. Synergy 4.\n    *(Reflects a wayfinder's quick reflexes and prepared navigation, granting a combat edge alongside a glimpse into the future.)*\n\n5.  **Outrigger Star-Skiff** {2}\n    Artifact - Vehicle\n    2/2\n    Crew 1\n    When you crew Outrigger Star-Skiff, Scry 1. You gain 1 life.\n    Complexity 4. Flavor 4. Synergy 4.\n    *(A simple lifegain effect representing drawing small amounts of mana for sustenance or ancestral blessing during a journey, paired with Wayfinding.)*\n\n6.  **Outrigger Star-Skiff** {3}\n    Artifact - Vehicle\n    2/3\n    Crew 2\n    When you crew Outrigger Star-Skiff, Scry 1.\n    Complexity 3. Flavor 4. Synergy 4.\n    *(A more defensively oriented stat line for scouting in dangerous areas, still providing the core Scry for Wayfinding.)*\n\n7.  **Outrigger Star-Skiff** {2}\n    Artifact - Vehicle\n    2/2\n    Crew 1\n    Whenever Outrigger Star-Skiff attacks, Scry 1.\n    Complexity 3. Flavor 5. Synergy 5.\n    *(Similar to option 1, but the Scry triggers on attack, symbolizing charting a course as the skiff pushes forward into unknown territory.)*\n\n8.  **Outrigger Star-Skiff** {3}\n    Artifact - Vehicle\n    2/3\n    Crew 2\n    Ward {1}\n    Complexity 4. Flavor 4. Synergy 4.\n    *(This option highlights ancestral protection, making the skiff slightly harder to remove, reflecting ancestral wisdom guiding its resilience without a direct Scry trigger.)*\n\n9.  **Outrigger Star-Skiff** {1}\n    Artifact - Vehicle\n    Flying\n    1/1\n    Crew 1\n    Complexity 3. Flavor 4. Synergy 3.\n    *(A very cheap, nimble scouting vehicle that provides basic evasion. It focuses on the \"nimble\" and \"ubiquitous\" aspects without a direct Wayfinding trigger.)*\n\n10. **Outrigger Star-Skiff** {3}\n    Artifact - Vehicle\n    2/2\n    Crew 2\n    When you crew Outrigger Star-Skiff, add {C}.\n    Complexity 3. Flavor 4. Synergy 4.\n    *(Represents the \"mana drawn from volcanic cores and celestial convergences\" that powers the skiffs, providing a small burst of colorless mana upon activation.)*\n- card_json: ```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"Outrigger Star-Skiff\",\n  \"supertype\": \"Artifact\",\n  \"subtype\": \"Vehicle\",\n  \"mana_cost\": \"{3}\",\n  \"power\": \"2\",\n  \"toughness\": \"2\",\n  \"rule_text\": \"Flying\\nCrew 1\\nWhen you crew Outrigger Star-Skiff, Scry 1.\",\n  \"rarity\": \"Common\"\n}\n```\n\nPrevious Step 'design_set_mechanics':\nHere is the mechanical framework for your Magic: The Gathering set, \"The Vela Archipelago\":\n\n---\n\n## 1.
