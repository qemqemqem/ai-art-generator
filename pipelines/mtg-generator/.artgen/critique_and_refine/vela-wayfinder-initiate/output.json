  "prompt": "Background Context:\nProject Context:\n- set_theme: A vibrant cosmic voyage set blending Polynesian wayfinding culture with interstellar exploration.\n\nThe Vela Archipelago - scattered island-worlds across a nebula-sea where ancient wayfinders navigate \nusing both star charts and ancestral spirits. Their great canoe-ships ride cosmic currents between \nworlds, powered by mana drawn from volcanic cores and celestial convergences.\n\nKey themes:\n- Wayfinding: Navigation using stars, currents, and spirit guides across both ocean and space\n- Ancestor spirits: Departed navigators whose spirits guide the living through dangerous passages\n- Mana as fuel: Volcanic/stellar energy that powers both magic and interstellar travel\n- Tattoo magic (Tatau): Sacred markings that store power, record lineage, and enable abilities\n- The Great Voyage: An ongoing journey to unite scattered island-worlds under one chiefdom\n- Cosmic sea creatures: Massive beings that swim between stars - some helpful guides, others apex predators\n- Coral nebulae: Beautiful but treacherous regions of space filled with life and danger\n\nVisual motifs: Intricate tribal patterns, bioluminescent creatures, volcanic islands floating in starfields,\noutrigger starships with solar sails, warriors with glowing tattoos, coral formations in nebula clouds.\n\n- set_size: 6\n\nCurrent Asset:\n- name: Vela Wayfinder Initiate\n- card_type: Creature - Human Warrior\n- rarity: Common\n- color: White\n- concept: This card represents a young Wayfinder, fresh from their initiation rites, embarking on their first voyages across the nebula-sea. They are a foundational warrior in the Chiefdom's ranks, learning to interpret the cosmic currents and star charts as part of the Great Voyage. Mechanically, they embody the spirit of Wayfinding by allowing players to scry, helping them navigate their own deck and prepare for what lies ahead.\n- mechanics_brainstorm: Here are 10 possible mechanics for Vela Wayfinder Initiate:\n\n1.  **When Vela Wayfinder Initiate enters the battlefield, scry 1.**\n    *   Complexity 2.
