  "prompt": "Background Context:\nProject Context:\n- set_theme: A vibrant cosmic voyage set blending Polynesian wayfinding culture with interstellar exploration.\n\nThe Vela Archipelago - scattered island-worlds across a nebula-sea where ancient wayfinders navigate \nusing both star charts and ancestral spirits. Their great canoe-ships ride cosmic currents between \nworlds, powered by mana drawn from volcanic cores and celestial convergences.\n\nKey themes:\n- Wayfinding: Navigation using stars, currents, and spirit guides across both ocean and space\n- Ancestor spirits: Departed navigators whose spirits guide the living through dangerous passages\n- Mana as fuel: Volcanic/stellar energy that powers both magic and interstellar travel\n- Tattoo magic (Tatau): Sacred markings that store power, record lineage, and enable abilities\n- The Great Voyage: An ongoing journey to unite scattered island-worlds under one chiefdom\n- Cosmic sea creatures: Massive beings that swim between stars - some helpful guides, others apex predators\n- Coral nebulae: Beautiful but treacherous regions of space filled with life and danger\n\nVisual motifs: Intricate tribal patterns, bioluminescent creatures, volcanic islands floating in starfields,\noutrigger starships with solar sails, warriors with glowing tattoos, coral formations in nebula clouds.\n\n- set_size: 6\n\nCurrent Asset:\n- name: Vela Wayfinder Initiate\n- card_type: Creature - Human Warrior\n- rarity: Common\n- color: White\n- concept: The Vela Wayfinder Initiate represents the next generation of navigators, fresh from their training and taking their first steps into the cosmic sea, learning to read the stars and currents. They are the hopeful future of the Chiefdom, embodying the spirit of discovery and resilience as they join the ongoing Great Voyage. Mechanically, they provide essential early-game board presence and help players chart their own course by offering a small but consistent scry effect, symbolizing their budding wayfinding skills.\n- mechanics_brainstorm: Here are 10 possible mechanics for Vela Wayfinder Initiate:\n\n1.  Whenever Vela Wayfinder Initiate attacks, scry 1.\n    *   Complexity 2.\n    *   Flavor 5 (Directly represents wayfinding and charting a course during a journey).\n    *   Synergy 5 (Scry is a primary white mechanic in the set, fitting the Wayfinding theme).\n\n2.  When Vela Wayfinder Initiate enters the battlefield, explore.\n    *   Complexity 2.\n    *   Flavor 5 (Represents taking its \"first steps into the cosmic sea\" and discovering what lies ahead).\n    *   Synergy 5 (Explore is a secondary white mechanic in the set, fitting Wayfinding and The Great Voyage).\n\n3.  Tatau 1 (When this creature enters the battlefield, put a +1/+1 counter on it. As long as it has one or more +1/+1 counters on it, it has vigilance.)\n    *   Complexity 3.\n    *   Flavor 4 (Symbolizes growing \"budding wayfinding skills\" and the vigilant nature of a cosmic navigator).\n    *   Synergy 4 (Tatau is the set's signature mechanic, and vigilance is a strong white keyword).\n\n4.  Vela Wayfinder Initiate can crew Vehicles as though its power were 1 greater.\n    *   Complexity 2.\n    *   Flavor 4 (Represents the Wayfinder's skill and dedication making them more effective at piloting starships).\n    *   Synergy 5 (Vehicles are a primary white mechanic in the set, fitting the starship theme).\n\n5.  Vigilance\n    *   Complexity 1.\n    *   Flavor 3 (Represents the Wayfinder's constant readiness and watchful eye, but less specific to the \"wayfinding\" aspect).\n    *   Synergy 3 (A standard white keyword, good for early board presence).\n\n6.  When Vela Wayfinder Initiate enters the battlefield, scry 1.\n    *   Complexity 2.\n    *   Flavor 4 (Represents an initial scan or divination upon arrival, aligning with \"first steps\").\n    *   Synergy 4 (Scry is a primary white mechanic, fitting Wayfinding, providing early-game consistency).\n\n7.  {W}, {T}: Target Vehicle you control gains vigilance until end of turn.\n    *   Complexity 2.\n    *   Flavor 4 (The Wayfinder guides and empowers the starships, allowing them to remain on watch).\n    *   Synergy 5 (Vehicles are a primary white mechanic, this provides a repeatable way to support them).\n\n8.  Whenever you cast a Vehicle spell, you may scry 1.\n    *   Complexity 3.\n    *   Flavor 5 (As new starships are prepared for voyage, the Wayfinder consults the stars to plan their journey).\n    *   Synergy 5 (Combines Scry and Vehicles, both primary white mechanics, in a thematic way).\n\n9.  Whenever Vela Wayfinder Initiate attacks, if you control a Vehicle, scry 1.\n    *   Complexity 3.\n    *   Flavor 5 (The Wayfinder charts the course for the fleet, guiding the starships as they move).\n    *   Synergy 5 (Links Scry and Vehicles directly, reinforcing the Wayfinding and starship fleet themes).\n\n10. When Vela Wayfinder Initiate dies, scry 1.\n    *   Complexity 2.\n    *   Flavor 4 (Even in passing, the Wayfinder's spirit offers guidance, drawing on the \"Ancestor spirits\" theme in a small way).\n    *   Synergy 4 (Scry is a key set mechanic, providing a small benefit even if the creature is removed).\n- card_json: ```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"Vela Wayfinder Initiate\",\n  \"supertype\": \"Creature\",\n  \"subtype\": \"Human Warrior\",\n  \"mana_cost\": \"{1}{W}\",\n  \"power\": \"1\",\n  \"toughness\": \"2\",\n  \"rule_text\": \"Vigilance\\nWhenever Vela Wayfinder Initiate attacks, scry 1.\",\n  \"rarity\": \"Common\"\n}\n```\n\nPrevious Step 'design_set_mechanics':\nHere is the mechanical framework for your Magic: The Gathering set, \"The Vela Archipelago\":\n\n---\n\n## 1.
