  "prompt": "Background Context:\nProject Context:\n- set_theme: A vibrant cosmic voyage set blending Polynesian wayfinding culture with interstellar exploration.\n\nThe Vela Archipelago - scattered island-worlds across a nebula-sea where ancient wayfinders navigate \nusing both star charts and ancestral spirits. Their great canoe-ships ride cosmic currents between \nworlds, powered by mana drawn from volcanic cores and celestial convergences.\n\nKey themes:\n- Wayfinding: Navigation using stars, currents, and spirit guides across both ocean and space\n- Ancestor spirits: Departed navigators whose spirits guide the living through dangerous passages\n- Mana as fuel: Volcanic/stellar energy that powers both magic and interstellar travel\n- Tattoo magic (Tatau): Sacred markings that store power, record lineage, and enable abilities\n- The Great Voyage: An ongoing journey to unite scattered island-worlds under one chiefdom\n- Cosmic sea creatures: Massive beings that swim between stars - some helpful guides, others apex predators\n- Coral nebulae: Beautiful but treacherous regions of space filled with life and danger\n\nVisual motifs: Intricate tribal patterns, bioluminescent creatures, volcanic islands floating in starfields,\noutrigger starships with solar sails, warriors with glowing tattoos, coral formations in nebula clouds.\n\n- set_size: 6\n\nCurrent Asset:\n- name: Vela Wayfinder Initiate\n- card_type: Creature - Human Warrior\n- rarity: Common\n- color: White\n- concept: This young Wayfinder has just begun their sacred training, learning to read the cosmic currents and ancient star-charts that guide their people across the nebula-sea. They represent the hopeful future of the Wayfinder Chiefdom, diligently practicing the essential art of navigation. Mechanically, they provide a small but consistent scry effect, embodying their initial steps in finding the correct path for the Great Voyage.\n- mechanics_brainstorm: Here are 10 possible mechanics/abilities for Vela Wayfinder Initiate:\n\n1.  **When Vela Wayfinder Initiate enters the battlefield, scry 1.**\n    *   Complexity 2. Flavor 5. Synergy 5.\n    *   *This option directly provides the small scry effect upon the initiate's arrival, representing their initial attempt to read the cosmic currents.*\n\n2.  **Whenever Vela Wayfinder Initiate attacks, scry 1.**\n    *   Complexity 2. Flavor 4. Synergy 5.\n    *   *This offers a consistent scry effect each turn the initiate participates in the ongoing \"Great Voyage,\" actively scouting ahead.*\n\n3.  **{1}{W}, {T}: Scry 1.**\n    *   Complexity 2. Flavor 4. Synergy 5.\n    *   *This provides a repeatable mana sink for scrying, representing the Wayfinder's diligent and continuous study of star-charts and cosmic patterns.*\n\n4.  **Tatau 1 (When this creature enters the battlefield, put a +1/+1 counter on it. As long as it has one or more +1/+1 counters on it, it has \"Whenever Vela Wayfinder Initiate attacks, scry 1.\")**\n    *   Complexity 4. Flavor 5. Synergy 5.\n    *   *This option uses the set's signature mechanic, showing the young Wayfinder gaining their first sacred tattoo and, through it, a consistent navigation ability as they train.*\n\n5.  **When Vela Wayfinder Initiate enters the battlefield, scry 1.\n    Crew 1.**\n    *   Complexity 3. Flavor 5. Synergy 5.\n    *   *Combines the initiate's navigational training with their role in operating the great starships, which is a primary White theme for the set.*\n\n6.  **Vigilance.\n    When Vela Wayfinder Initiate enters the battlefield, scry 1.**\n    *   Complexity 3. Flavor 4. Synergy 4.\n    *   *Vigilance represents the Wayfinder's constant watchfulness and readiness, coupled with their initial act of charting a course.*\n\n7.  **When Vela Wayfinder Initiate enters the battlefield, scry 1. If you control a Vehicle, put a +1/+1 counter on Vela Wayfinder Initiate.**\n    *   Complexity 3. Flavor 4. Synergy 4.\n    *   *The initiate gains confidence and strength when near a starship, embodying their connection to the fleet while also performing their navigational duty.*\n\n8.  **Whenever you cast a creature spell, scry 1.**\n    *   Complexity 2. Flavor 4. Synergy 4.\n    *   *This reflects the Wayfinder gaining new insights or adjusting their course as new crew members or allies join the expedition.*\n\n9.  **When Vela Wayfinder Initiate enters the battlefield, scry 1.\n    You gain 1 life.**\n    *   Complexity 3. Flavor 3. Synergy 4.\n    *   *A simple, common White combination. The scry represents finding a hopeful path, leading to a small burst of safety or vigor.*\n\n10. **Whenever another Human enters the battlefield under your control, scry 1.**\n    *   Complexity 3. Flavor 4. Synergy 4.\n    *   *This highlights the communal aspect of the Wayfinder Chiefdom, where the initiate learns or finds inspiration from fellow humans joining the journey or populating the island-worlds.*\n- card_json: ```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"Vela Wayfinder Initiate\",\n  \"supertype\": \"Creature\",\n  \"subtype\": \"Human Warrior\",\n  \"mana_cost\": \"{1}{W}\",\n  \"power\": \"1\",\n  \"toughness\": \"2\",\n  \"rule_text\": \"When Vela Wayfinder Initiate enters the battlefield, scry 1.\\nCrew 1 (Tap any number of creatures you control with total power 1 or more: This Vehicle becomes an artifact creature until end of turn.)\",\n  \"rarity\": \"Common\"\n}\n```\n\nPrevious Step 'design_set_mechanics':\nHere is the mechanical framework for your Magic: The Gathering set, \"The Vela Archipelago\":\n\n---\n\n## 1.
