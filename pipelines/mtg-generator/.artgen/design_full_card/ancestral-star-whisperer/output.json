Their great canoe-ships ride cosmic currents between \nworlds, powered by mana drawn from volcanic cores and celestial convergences.\n\nKey themes:\n- Wayfinding: Navigation using stars, currents, and spirit guides across both ocean and space\n- Ancestor spirits: Departed navigators whose spirits guide the living through dangerous passages\n- Mana as fuel: Volcanic/stellar energy that powers both magic and interstellar travel\n- Tattoo magic (Tatau): Sacred markings that store power, record lineage, and enable abilities\n- The Great Voyage: An ongoing journey to unite scattered island-worlds under one chiefdom\n- Cosmic sea creatures: Massive beings that swim between stars - some helpful guides, others apex predators\n- Coral nebulae: Beautiful but treacherous regions of space filled with life and danger\n\nVisual motifs: Intricate tribal patterns, bioluminescent creatures, volcanic islands floating in starfields,\noutrigger starships with solar sails, warriors with glowing tattoos, coral formations in nebula clouds.\n\n- set_size: 6\n\nCurrent Asset:\n- name: Ancestral Star-Whisperer\n- card_type: Creature - Spirit Wizard\n- rarity: Uncommon\n- color: Blue\n- concept: The Ancestral Star-Whisperer represents a revered Wayfinder whose spirit transcends physical death, continuing to guide the living through the treacherous nebula-sea. These ethereal wizards whisper lost knowledge and foresight through the cosmic currents, helping current navigators chart safe paths and anticipate the encroaching Void Blight. Mechanically, they provide a consistent advantage by allowing players to scry and manipulate the flow of their deck, embodying the wayfinding theme of anticipating future challenges.\n- mechanics_brainstorm: Here are 10 possible mechanics for Ancestral Star-Whisperer:\n\n1.
