Their great canoe-ships ride cosmic currents between \nworlds, powered by mana drawn from volcanic cores and celestial convergences.\n\nKey themes:\n- Wayfinding: Navigation using stars, currents, and spirit guides across both ocean and space\n- Ancestor spirits: Departed navigators whose spirits guide the living through dangerous passages\n- Mana as fuel: Volcanic/stellar energy that powers both magic and interstellar travel\n- Tattoo magic (Tatau): Sacred markings that store power, record lineage, and enable abilities\n- The Great Voyage: An ongoing journey to unite scattered island-worlds under one chiefdom\n- Cosmic sea creatures: Massive beings that swim between stars - some helpful guides, others apex predators\n- Coral nebulae: Beautiful but treacherous regions of space filled with life and danger\n\nVisual motifs: Intricate tribal patterns, bioluminescent creatures, volcanic islands floating in starfields,\noutrigger starships with solar sails, warriors with glowing tattoos, coral formations in nebula clouds.\n\n- set_size: 6\n\nCurrent Asset:\n- name: Mana-Core Eruption\n- card_type: Sorcery\n- rarity: Rare\n- color: Red\n- concept: \"Mana-Core Eruption\" captures the awe-inspiring and destructive power unleashed when an island-world's mana core becomes unstable and erupts. Such events are natural forces of creation and destruction, intensified by the Void Blight, hinting at the desperate measures Wayfinders might take or the catastrophic results of High Priestess Xylara's unchecked mana siphoning. Mechanically, it offers a dramatic, one-time burst of raw energy, representing a pivotal and impactful moment in a game.\n- mechanics_brainstorm: Here are 10 possible mechanics/abilities for \"Mana-Core Eruption\":\n\n1.  **Oracle text:** Mana-Core Eruption deals 4 damage to each creature and each opponent. You may return a land you control to your hand. If you do, you may put a land card from your hand onto the battlefield.\n    *   **Complexity:** 7 (AOE damage 3 + optional land return 2 + optional land drop 2)\n    *   **Flavor:** 5 (The eruption causes widespread damage, then Wayfinders quickly adapt by shifting their land-world's position, representing resource management and the shifting nature of the archipelago.)\n    *   **Synergy:** 5 (Directly supports \"Landfall\" by enabling a trigger, and aligns with red's destructive tendencies and themes of \"Mana as Fuel\" for re-establishing a land connection.)\n\n2.  **Oracle text:** Mana-Core Eruption deals 5 damage to target player or planeswalker. Until the end of your next turn, whenever you cast a noncreature spell, you may add {R}{R} to your mana pool.\n    *   **Complexity:** 7 (Targeted damage 3 + delayed mana trigger for specific spell type 4)\n    *   **Flavor:** 5 (A concentrated eruption deals a massive blow, and the unleashed mana lingers, ready to be channeled into subsequent magical efforts.)\n    *   **Synergy:** 5 (Strong synergy with \"Prowess\" creatures, providing abundant mana to chain noncreature spells. Fits \"Mana as Fuel\" and red's spell-slinging nature.)\n\n3.  **Oracle text:** As an additional cost to cast this spell, sacrifice any number of lands. Mana-Core Eruption deals X damage to each non-land permanent and each opponent, where X is the number of lands sacrificed this way. You gain X mana of any one color.\n    *   **Complexity:** 7 (Sacrifice cost 2 + scaling AOE damage 3 + mana gain 2)\n    *   **Flavor:** 5 (A desperate, catastrophic measure where a Wayfinder sacrifices parts of their island-world for an overwhelming burst of destructive power, temporarily siphoning immense raw mana.)\n    *   **Synergy:** 4 (Fits the \"Mana as Fuel\" theme dramatically and black-red \"Mana Siphoners\" archetype, leveraging resource sacrifice for explosive effects.)\n\n4.  **Oracle text:** Mana-Core Eruption deals 5 damage to target creature or planeswalker and 2 damage to each other creature.\n    Flashback {4RR}, sacrifice a land.\n    *   **Complexity:** 7 (Targeted damage 2 + AOE damage 2 + Flashback with additional cost 3)\n    *   **Flavor:** 5 (The initial eruption is devastating. The ability to \"flashback\" represents the persistent instability of a mana core or a repeated, desperate siphoning, potentially guided by ancestral spirits or the destructive will of High Priestess Xylara.)\n    *   **Synergy:** 5 (Utilizes \"Flashback,\" a key set mechanic for calling upon past power, and directly ties into \"Mana as Fuel\" and destructive themes with the land sacrifice.)\n\n5.  **Oracle text:** Mana-Core Eruption deals 4 damage to each creature. It deals 2 damage to each opponent. You may put a land card from your hand onto the battlefield. If you do, scry 2.\n    *   **Complexity:** 8 (AOE creature damage 3 + AOE opponent damage 2 + optional land drop 2 + conditional scry 1)\n    *   **Flavor:** 5 (A widespread catastrophic event clears threats, and in the aftermath, Wayfinders can quickly establish new footing (landfall) and divine their next course (scry).)\n    *   **Synergy:** 5 (Combines red's destructive power with \"Landfall\" and \"Scry,\" both primary mechanics, aligning with Wayfinding's need to navigate and adapt after cataclysmic events.)\n\n6.  **Oracle text:** Exile Mana-Core Eruption as it resolves. At the beginning of your next upkeep, put X 1/1 red Elemental creature tokens onto the battlefield, where X is the number of lands you control. Those tokens have \"This creature gets +1/+0 for each Mountain you control.\"\n    *   **Complexity:** 7 (Exile 1 + delayed token creation with variable amount 4 + conditional buff 2)\n    *   **Flavor:** 5 (The eruption is a massive force of creation and destruction, transforming raw mana into volatile Elementals that surge from the land, becoming stronger with the presence of volcanic mana.)\n    *   **Synergy:** 4 (Plays into \"Mana as Fuel\" and \"Landfall\" by rewarding having many lands. Fits red's Elemental themes and the \"Volcanic Growth\" archetype.)\n\n7.  **Oracle text:** Mana-Core Eruption deals 3 damage to each creature. Lands your opponents control lose all abilities and become basic Mountains until the end of your next turn.\n    *   **Complexity:** 7 (AOE damage 3 + temporary land modification 4)\n    *   **Flavor:** 5 (The eruption damages creatures, and the raw mana flow from the unstable core temporarily overwhelms enemy island-worlds, disrupting their natural properties and converting them into volatile red mana sources.)\n    *   **Synergy:** 4 (Aligns with red's aggressive disruption and desire to dominate mana sources. Provides tempo against opponents relying on non-basic lands.)\n\n8.  **Oracle text:** Mana-Core Eruption deals 6 damage to target player or planeswalker. If you control a creature with prowess, this spell deals 2 damage to each of up to two other targets.\n    *   **Complexity:** 7 (Targeted damage 2 + conditional additional damage with multiple targets 3 + prowess check 2)\n    *   **Flavor:** 5 (A focused, destructive burst of mana. If a skilled Wayfinder or Tattooed warrior is present (Prowess), they can deftly channel the overflow into additional precise strikes.)\n    *   **Synergy:** 5 (Directly rewards having \"Prowess\" creatures, a primary red mechanic, making this a powerful finisher or removal spell in UR or WR spellslinger archetypes.)\n\n9.  **Oracle text:** Mana-Core Eruption deals 3 damage to each creature an opponent controls. Put a +1/+1 counter on each creature you control. If you put one or more +1/+1 counters on creatures this way, draw a card.\n    *   **Complexity:** 7 (Targeted AOE damage 3 + mass counter placement 2 + conditional card draw 2)\n    *   **Flavor:** 5 (The eruption devastates enemy creatures, but simultaneously infuses your own forces with raw mana, strengthening their \"Tatau\" and granting new insights (drawing a card) from the mana surge.)\n    *   **Synergy:** 5 (Excellent synergy with \"Tatau\" creatures, immediately strengthening them and potentially enabling their abilities, while providing card advantage.)\n\n10. **Oracle text:** Destroy target land. Add {R}{R}{R}{R} to your mana pool. At the beginning of your next end step, sacrifice a land.\n    *   **Complexity:** 7 (Targeted destruction 2 + massive mana gain 2 + delayed sacrifice 3)\n    *   **Flavor:** 5 (A direct, aggressive act of siphoning immense mana from a chosen island-world, granting an immediate power surge but incurring a lingering cost due to the instability it causes.)\n    *   **Synergy:** 4 (Fits the \"Mana as Fuel\" theme perfectly. Enables powerful plays by providing a huge temporary mana boost, but with a drawback representing the cost of such an extreme action. Good for BR \"Mana Siphoners.\")\n\nPrevious Step 'design_set_mechanics':\nHere is the mechanical framework for your Magic: The Gathering set, \"The Vela Archipelago\":\n\n---\n\n## 1.
