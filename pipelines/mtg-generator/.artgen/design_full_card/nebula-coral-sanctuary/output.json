Their great canoe-ships ride cosmic currents between \nworlds, powered by mana drawn from volcanic cores and celestial convergences.\n\nKey themes:\n- Wayfinding: Navigation using stars, currents, and spirit guides across both ocean and space\n- Ancestor spirits: Departed navigators whose spirits guide the living through dangerous passages\n- Mana as fuel: Volcanic/stellar energy that powers both magic and interstellar travel\n- Tattoo magic (Tatau): Sacred markings that store power, record lineage, and enable abilities\n- The Great Voyage: An ongoing journey to unite scattered island-worlds under one chiefdom\n- Cosmic sea creatures: Massive beings that swim between stars - some helpful guides, others apex predators\n- Coral nebulae: Beautiful but treacherous regions of space filled with life and danger\n\nVisual motifs: Intricate tribal patterns, bioluminescent creatures, volcanic islands floating in starfields,\noutrigger starships with solar sails, warriors with glowing tattoos, coral formations in nebula clouds.\n\n- set_size: 6\n\nCurrent Asset:\n- name: Nebula Coral Sanctuary\n- card_type: Enchantment\n- rarity: Uncommon\n- color: Green\n- concept: Nebula Coral Sanctuary represents a pristine pocket of the cosmic coral nebulae, a breathtaking expanse of vibrant life and raw mana untouched by the encroaching Void Blight. It serves as a vital sanctuary for cosmic sea creatures and a source of hope for Wayfinders like Kaelen, embodying the natural resilience the archipelago fights to preserve. Mechanically, it could foster the growth of smaller creatures or provide a consistent source of mana, reflecting its abundant and protective nature.\n- mechanics_brainstorm: Here are 10 possible mechanics/abilities for Nebula Coral Sanctuary:\n\n1.  Whenever a land enters the battlefield under your control, add {G}.\n    *   Complexity: 2\n    *   Flavor: 4 (Represents the \"raw mana\" and \"abundant\" nature tied to the discovery of new island-worlds and fertile nebulae.)\n    *   Synergy: 5 (Directly supports Green's **Landfall** mechanic, providing consistent mana generation.)\n\n2.  Creature spells you cast cost {1} less to cast.\n    *   Complexity: 2\n    *   Flavor: 4 (Embodies \"foster the growth of smaller creatures\" and bringing life into the sanctuary with abundant mana.)\n    *   Synergy: 3 (Supports Green's general creature-heavy strategy, but not directly a set mechanic.)\n\n3.  Whenever you explore, put a +1/+1 counter on target creature you control.\n    *   Complexity: 3\n    *   Flavor: 4 (Exploration and discovery within the nebulae lead to the growth and strengthening of creatures in the sanctuary.)\n    *   Synergy: 5 (Directly synergizes with Green's **Explore** mechanic and the **Tatau** mechanic by adding +1/+1 counters.)\n\n4.  Creatures you control with one or more +1/+1 counters on them have vigilance.\n    *   Complexity: 3\n    *   Flavor: 3 (Represents the constant readiness and resilience of life that has thrived and grown within the sanctuary.)\n    *   Synergy: 4 (Strong synergy with **Tatau** and **Explore** which both put +1/+1 counters on creatures.)\n\n5.  Beasts, Krakens, and Leviathans you control get +1/+1.\n    *   Complexity: 2\n    *   Flavor: 4 (Explicitly highlights the sanctuary's role for \"cosmic sea creatures\" by making them larger and more formidable.)\n    *   Synergy: 3 (Supports Green's affinity for these large creature types, but not a direct set mechanic.)\n\n6.  As long as you control four or more lands, creatures you control have hexproof.\n    *   Complexity: 3\n    *   Flavor: 5 (Perfectly captures the \"pristine pocket\" and \"untouched by the encroaching Void Blight\" aspects, offering protection once the sanctuary is established.)\n    *   Synergy: 4 (Synergizes with **Landfall** by rewarding establishing a strong land base.)\n\n7.  Whenever one or more +1/+1 counters are put on a creature you control, you gain 1 life.\n    *   Complexity: 3\n    *   Flavor: 4 (Growth and thriving life within the sanctuary provides a \"source of hope\" and vitality.)\n    *   Synergy: 5 (Excellent synergy with **Explore** and **Tatau**, rewarding the set's primary counter-based mechanics.)\n\n8.  At the beginning of your end step, if you control a creature with a +1/+1 counter on it, draw a card.\n    *   Complexity: 3\n    *   Flavor: 4 (The thriving, growing life within the sanctuary leads to new discoveries and continued \"hope\" for the Wayfinders.)\n    *   Synergy: 5 (Strong card advantage for decks utilizing **Tatau** and **Explore**, helping to find more threats or answers.)\n\n9.  Prevent all noncombat damage that would be dealt to creatures you control with one or more +1/+1 counters on them.\n    *   Complexity: 3\n    *   Flavor: 5 (Emphasizes the \"sanctuary\" and \"untouched by the encroaching Void Blight\" theme by protecting growing creatures from harmful spells or abilities.)\n    *   Synergy: 5 (Provides crucial protection for creatures powered up by **Tatau** and **Explore**.)\n\n10. Whenever you cast a creature spell with mana value 4 or greater, put a +1/+1 counter on target creature you control.\n    *   Complexity: 3\n    *   Flavor: 4 (Represents the immense \"raw mana\" and abundant life of the sanctuary nourishing and augmenting powerful cosmic creatures as they arrive.)\n    *   Synergy: 4 (Supports Green's tendency to play large creatures and synergizes with **Tatau** and other +1/+1 counter strategies.)\n\nPrevious Step 'design_set_mechanics':\nHere is the mechanical framework for your Magic: The Gathering set, \"The Vela Archipelago\":\n\n---\n\n## 1.
