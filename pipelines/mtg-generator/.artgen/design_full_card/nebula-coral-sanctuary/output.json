  "prompt": "Background Context:\nProject Context:\n- set_theme: A vibrant cosmic voyage set blending Polynesian wayfinding culture with interstellar exploration.\n\nThe Vela Archipelago - scattered island-worlds across a nebula-sea where ancient wayfinders navigate \nusing both star charts and ancestral spirits. Their great canoe-ships ride cosmic currents between \nworlds, powered by mana drawn from volcanic cores and celestial convergences.\n\nKey themes:\n- Wayfinding: Navigation using stars, currents, and spirit guides across both ocean and space\n- Ancestor spirits: Departed navigators whose spirits guide the living through dangerous passages\n- Mana as fuel: Volcanic/stellar energy that powers both magic and interstellar travel\n- Tattoo magic (Tatau): Sacred markings that store power, record lineage, and enable abilities\n- The Great Voyage: An ongoing journey to unite scattered island-worlds under one chiefdom\n- Cosmic sea creatures: Massive beings that swim between stars - some helpful guides, others apex predators\n- Coral nebulae: Beautiful but treacherous regions of space filled with life and danger\n\nVisual motifs: Intricate tribal patterns, bioluminescent creatures, volcanic islands floating in starfields,\noutrigger starships with solar sails, warriors with glowing tattoos, coral formations in nebula clouds.\n\n- set_size: 6\n\nCurrent Asset:\n- name: Nebula Coral Sanctuary\n- card_type: Enchantment\n- rarity: Uncommon\n- color: Green\n- concept: This card represents a vibrant, pristine pocket of the Living Reef of Lumina, a mana-rich coral nebula untouched by the encroaching Void Blight. It serves as a vital sanctuary where cosmic life flourishes, providing hope and sustenance for the Wayfinders fighting to preserve their world. Mechanically, it would likely provide a steady stream of mana or help grow your forces, reflecting its bountiful and nurturing nature.\n- mechanics_brainstorm: Here are 10 possible mechanics for \"Nebula Coral Sanctuary\":\n\n1.  **Whenever a land enters the battlefield under your control, put a +1/+1 counter on target creature you control and you gain 1 life.**\n    *   Complexity 5. Flavor 5. Synergy 5.\n    *   *Justification:* Directly leverages the \"mana-rich\" and \"bountiful\" aspects through the Landfall mechanic (primary Green). It represents the sanctuary providing both growth (+1/+1 counters, synergistic with Tatau and Explore) and sustenance (life gain) as new resources (lands) are discovered or connected.\n\n2.  **Tap an untapped creature you control: Add {G}. If that creature has a +1/+1 counter on it, put another +1/+1 counter on it.**\n    *   Complexity 4. Flavor 5. Synergy 5.\n    *   *Justification:* Shows the cosmic life within the sanctuary actively contributing to its mana pool, and in return, those empowered creatures are further strengthened, tying into the \"Mana as Fuel\" and \"Tatau\" themes.\n\n3.  **Whenever a creature you control explores, if you put a +1/+1 counter on it, draw a card.**\n    *   Complexity 5. Flavor 5. Synergy 5.\n    *   *Justification:* Directly enhances the \"Explore\" mechanic (primary Green/White/Blue) by rewarding successful exploration with card advantage, symbolizing the sanctuary providing knowledge and sustenance from its rich environment.\n\n4.  **At the beginning of your upkeep, create a 1/1 green Sapling creature token. If you control a creature with three or more +1/+1 counters on it, create two instead.**\n    *   Complexity 5. Flavor 5. Synergy 5.\n    *   *Justification:* Represents the \"cosmic life flourishes\" aspect by generating creature tokens. The conditional creation of two tokens ties into the \"Tatau\" and \"Explore\" themes, showing the sanctuary becoming more bountiful as your forces grow.\n\n5.  **Whenever a creature you control with a +1/+1 counter on it dies, you may pay {1}{G}. If you do, return it to your hand.**\n    *   Complexity 5. Flavor 5. Synergy 5.\n    *   *Justification:* Reflects the sanctuary as a place of hope and resilience, allowing the Wayfinders (especially those marked by Tatau or strengthened by Explore) to endure and return from dangerous passages.\n\n6.  **At the beginning of your precombat main phase, you may reveal the top card of your library. If it's a land card, you may put it onto the battlefield. Otherwise, put it into your hand.**\n    *   Complexity 5. Flavor 5. Synergy 5.\n    *   *Justification:* Emphasizes the \"mana-rich\" and \"bountiful\" nature, providing consistent land drops (Landfall synergy) or card advantage (sustenance) at a key point in your turn, symbolizing the sanctuary revealing its bounty.\n\n7.  **Whenever another creature enters the battlefield under your control, put a +1/+1 counter on it and you gain 1 life.**\n    *   Complexity 4. Flavor 5. Synergy 5.\n    *   *Justification:* A more general \"creature growth\" and \"sustenance\" effect for the sanctuary. Every new life brought forth is nourished and strengthened, aligning with Green's core themes and Tatau synergy.\n\n8.  **{1}{G}, {T}: Put a +1/+1 counter on target creature. It gains vigilance until end of turn.**\n    *   Complexity 3. Flavor 4. Synergy 4.\n    *   *Justification:* The sanctuary's ambient mana can be channeled to quickly empower a creature, providing both growth (+1/+1 counter, Tatau synergy) and a defensive posture (vigilance) to its inhabitants.\n\n9.  **Whenever you cast a creature spell, untap up to two lands you control.**\n    *   Complexity 4. Flavor 4. Synergy 4.\n    *   *Justification:* Reflects the sanctuary's mana-rich environment. Summoning more cosmic life or Wayfinders into the sanctuary rejuvenates the land's mana, allowing for more spells or future actions.\n\n10. **As long as you control a creature with a +1/+1 counter on it, Nebula Coral Sanctuary has hexproof.**\n    *   Complexity 3. Flavor 4. Synergy 4.\n    *   *Justification:* The vibrant cosmic life (represented by creatures with +1/+1 counters from Tatau or Explore) within the sanctuary protects it from external threats, emphasizing its role as a \"sanctuary untouched by the encroaching Void Blight.\"\n\nPrevious Step 'design_set_mechanics':\nHere is the mechanical framework for your Magic: The Gathering set, \"The Vela Archipelago\":\n\n---\n\n## 1.
