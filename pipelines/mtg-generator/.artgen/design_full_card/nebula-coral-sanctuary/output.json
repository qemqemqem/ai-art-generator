Their great canoe-ships ride cosmic currents between \nworlds, powered by mana drawn from volcanic cores and celestial convergences.\n\nKey themes:\n- Wayfinding: Navigation using stars, currents, and spirit guides across both ocean and space\n- Ancestor spirits: Departed navigators whose spirits guide the living through dangerous passages\n- Mana as fuel: Volcanic/stellar energy that powers both magic and interstellar travel\n- Tattoo magic (Tatau): Sacred markings that store power, record lineage, and enable abilities\n- The Great Voyage: An ongoing journey to unite scattered island-worlds under one chiefdom\n- Cosmic sea creatures: Massive beings that swim between stars - some helpful guides, others apex predators\n- Coral nebulae: Beautiful but treacherous regions of space filled with life and danger\n\nVisual motifs: Intricate tribal patterns, bioluminescent creatures, volcanic islands floating in starfields,\noutrigger starships with solar sails, warriors with glowing tattoos, coral formations in nebula clouds.\n\n- set_size: 6\n\nCurrent Asset:\n- name: Nebula Coral Sanctuary\n- card_type: Enchantment\n- rarity: Uncommon\n- color: Green\n- concept: This card represents a vibrant, untouched expanse of the nebula-sea's living coral, a haven pulsating with pure mana and unique cosmic life, providing refuge from the dangers of space. In the set's story, these sanctuaries are critical sources of strength and hope, fiercely protected by Wayfinders like Kaelen from the encroaching Void Blight. Mechanically, it would reflect this by steadily generating resources or protecting your creatures, allowing you to establish a safe and growing board state.\n- mechanics_brainstorm: Here are 10 possible mechanics/abilities for Nebula Coral Sanctuary:\n\n1.  **Whenever a land enters the battlefield under your control, add {G} to your mana pool.** Complexity 2. Flavor 5 (Represents the sanctuary pulsating with pure mana, making resources readily available from connections to the land/nebula). Synergy 5 (Strong Landfall synergy, a primary green mechanic, directly generates resources).\n2.  **Whenever a land enters the battlefield under your control, put a +1/+1 counter on target creature you control, then that creature explores.** Complexity 4. Flavor 5 (Connecting new discoveries/lands to the growth of unique life and the Wayfinders' exploration). Synergy 5 (Combines Landfall, Tatau, and Explore, all primary green mechanics and themes).\n3.  **Creatures you control have ward {1}.** Complexity 2. Flavor 5 (The sanctuary acts as a refuge, providing a protective aura from the dangers of the cosmic sea). Synergy 4 (Offers general creature protection, supporting a safe board state).\n4.  **At the beginning of your upkeep, put a +1/+1 counter on each creature you control with a +1/+1 counter on it.** Complexity 3. Flavor 5 (Depicts the sanctuary's energy fostering accelerated growth within thriving cosmic life). Synergy 5 (Highly synergistic with Tatau, rapidly growing creatures into powerful threats).\n5.  **At the beginning of your end step, create a 1/1 green Coral Elemental creature token.** Complexity 3. Flavor 5 (Represents the unique cosmic life found within the vibrant coral, steadily growing your board). Synergy 4 (Provides continuous board presence, tokens can block, attack, or crew Vehicles).\n6.  **You may play an additional land on each of your turns.** Complexity 2. Flavor 5 (Embodies the rapid expansion and discovery of new island-worlds facilitated by the sanctuary's abundant mana). Synergy 5 (A staple green ramp effect that directly enables Landfall triggers and allows for a faster \"growing board state\").\n7.  **Whenever a land enters the battlefield under your control, look at the top two cards of your library, then put one on the bottom of your library and the other on top.** Complexity 3. Flavor 5 (Landfall triggering Wayfinding; discovering new parts of the nebula-sea allows for charting better courses). Synergy 5 (Excellent Landfall and Scry synergy, helping to find key cards).\n8.  **Whenever a creature you control explores, put a +1/+1 counter on it and scry 1.** Complexity 4. Flavor 5 (Exploration within the sanctuary yields both growth for creatures and foresight for Wayfinders). Synergy 5 (Significantly enhances the Explore mechanic, also synergizes with Tatau and Scry).\n9.  **Whenever a creature you control dies, if it had a +1/+1 counter on it, you may pay {1}. If you do, return it to its owner's hand.** Complexity 3. Flavor 4 (The sanctuary's life-giving mana offering a chance for fallen unique life or wayfinders to return). Synergy 5 (Provides resilience for Tatau creatures, allowing them to be repeatedly cast or re-use ETB effects).\n10. **At the beginning of your end step, if you control a creature with a +1/+1 counter on it, draw a card.** Complexity 3. Flavor 4 (The thriving, growing life within the sanctuary provides steady knowledge or resources). Synergy 5 (Rewards building a growing board state with Tatau creatures by providing consistent card advantage).\n\nPrevious Step 'design_set_mechanics':\nHere is the mechanical framework for your Magic: The Gathering set, \"The Vela Archipelago\":\n\n---\n\n## 1.
