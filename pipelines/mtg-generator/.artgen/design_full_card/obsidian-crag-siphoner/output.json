  "prompt": "Background Context:\nProject Context:\n- set_theme: A vibrant cosmic voyage set blending Polynesian wayfinding culture with interstellar exploration.\n\nThe Vela Archipelago - scattered island-worlds across a nebula-sea where ancient wayfinders navigate \nusing both star charts and ancestral spirits. Their great canoe-ships ride cosmic currents between \nworlds, powered by mana drawn from volcanic cores and celestial convergences.\n\nKey themes:\n- Wayfinding: Navigation using stars, currents, and spirit guides across both ocean and space\n- Ancestor spirits: Departed navigators whose spirits guide the living through dangerous passages\n- Mana as fuel: Volcanic/stellar energy that powers both magic and interstellar travel\n- Tattoo magic (Tatau): Sacred markings that store power, record lineage, and enable abilities\n- The Great Voyage: An ongoing journey to unite scattered island-worlds under one chiefdom\n- Cosmic sea creatures: Massive beings that swim between stars - some helpful guides, others apex predators\n- Coral nebulae: Beautiful but treacherous regions of space filled with life and danger\n\nVisual motifs: Intricate tribal patterns, bioluminescent creatures, volcanic islands floating in starfields,\noutrigger starships with solar sails, warriors with glowing tattoos, coral formations in nebula clouds.\n\n- set_size: 6\n\nCurrent Asset:\n- name: Obsidian Crag Siphoner\n- card_type: Creature - Human Shaman\n- rarity: Common\n- color: Black\n- concept: Obsidian Crag Siphoners are shamans twisted by High Priestess Xylara's influence, dedicated to drawing power from the very heart of the scattered island-worlds. Operating from Xylara's stronghold, they perform dark rituals to drain vital mana from vulnerable locations, feeding it to the encroaching Void Blight. As common adherents to Xylara's cause, they could mechanically represent this corruption by allowing players to gain small, incremental advantages by siphoning mana or sacrificing other resources.\n- mechanics_brainstorm: Here are 10 possible mechanics for the \"Obsidian Crag Siphoner\" card, keeping its black color, common rarity, and the set's themes in mind:\n\n---\n\n**Obsidian Crag Siphoner**\nCreature - Human Shaman\nBlack, Common\n\n---\n\n1.  **{T}: Add {B}. You lose 1 life.**\n    *   Complexity: 1\n    *   Flavor: 5 (Directly represents draining vital mana through dark rituals, with a personal cost. Highly thematic for \"siphoning mana\" and \"twisted by influence.\")\n    *   Synergy: 4 (Provides mana acceleration for black strategies, fueling spells and abilities, and subtly plays into black's tendency to pay life for advantage.)\n\n2.  **{1}{B}, {T}: Sacrifice another creature. You gain 2 life.**\n    *   Complexity: 2\n    *   Flavor: 4 (Captures the essence of \"sacrificing other resources\" and \"dark rituals\" to draw power. The life gain represents the siphoner's own sustenance from the sacrifice.)\n    *   Synergy: 4 (Strongly supports WB/BR sacrifice archetypes, turning expendable creatures into incremental life advantage.)\n\n3.  **{T}, Sacrifice another creature: Scry 1.**\n    *   Complexity: 2\n    *   Flavor: 4 (Sacrificing a life force to gain forbidden knowledge or divine the path ahead fits the \"twisted shaman\" and \"wayfinding\" themes from a darker perspective.)\n    *   Synergy: 4 (Combines sacrifice synergy with the set's primary \"Scry\" mechanic, offering a way to smooth draws in black-aligned decks.)\n\n4.  **When Obsidian Crag Siphoner dies, target opponent loses 1 life.**\n    *   Complexity: 1\n    *   Flavor: 4 (The siphoner's final act, even in death, is to drain from an opponent, representing a lingering curse or a final surge of its twisted power \"feeding the Void Blight.\")\n    *   Synergy: 3 (A simple, common death trigger that contributes to attrition strategies, useful in any black deck.)\n\n5.  **{B}, {T}: Target opponent loses 1 life.**\n    *   Complexity: 2\n    *   Flavor: 4 (A direct representation of \"siphoning mana\" or life from an opponent, feeding the Void Blight through gradual harm. Classic black drain effect.)\n    *   Synergy: 4 (Supports UB/BR drain strategies and contributes to grinding down opponents in longer games.)\n\n6.  **Whenever a land enters the battlefield under an opponent's control, you gain 1 life.**\n    *   Complexity: 2\n    *   Flavor: 4 (Represents the siphoner drawing power or sustenance from the opponent's growth, \"draining vital mana from vulnerable locations\" as new island-worlds are explored.)\n    *   Synergy: 3 (A reactive ability that provides incremental life gain, disrupting opponent's tempo by turning their land drops into a small advantage for you.)\n\n7.  **{2}{B}, {T}: Return target creature card with mana value 1 or less from your graveyard to your hand.**\n    *   Complexity: 2\n    *   Flavor: 3 (While not direct \"mana siphoning,\" it represents the shamans dabbling in dark rituals to call back lesser spirits or corrupted creatures from the void, feeding on what's lost.)\n    *   Synergy: 4 (Excellent for WB/BG graveyard archetypes, providing recurring value from your own or sacrificed creatures.)\n\n8.  **{T}, Discard a card: You gain 1 life.**\n    *   Complexity: 2\n    *   Flavor: 3 (Sacrificing a piece of knowledge or a resource (a card) to gain a small surge of life, symbolizing feeding the Void Blight with discarded potential. Less \"mana siphoning\" but still resource manipulation.)\n    *   Synergy: 4 (Supports UB/BR strategies that benefit from cards in the graveyard or that want to cycle through their hand.)\n\n9.  **{1}{B}, {T}: Target opponent loses 1 life and you gain 1 life.**\n    *   Complexity: 2\n    *   Flavor: 4 (The iconic \"siphon\" effect, perfectly encapsulating drawing power from an opponent to strengthen oneself, a classic \"dark ritual\" effect that fits the concept well.)\n    *   Synergy: 4 (A fundamental drain effect that powers attrition and control strategies in UB/BR archetypes.)\n\n10. **{B}, Sacrifice Obsidian Crag Siphoner: Target opponent mills two cards.**\n    *   Complexity: 2\n    *   Flavor: 3 (The siphoner, in a final act of devotion, consumes itself to feed the \"encroaching Void Blight\" by stripping away the opponent's resources/future spells, representing decay.)\n    *   Synergy: 4 (Supports UB graveyard-centric strategies by increasing the number of cards in the opponent's graveyard, potentially enabling their own Flashback or other graveyard synergies.)\n\nPrevious Step 'design_set_mechanics':\nHere is the mechanical framework for your Magic: The Gathering set, \"The Vela Archipelago\":\n\n---\n\n## 1.
