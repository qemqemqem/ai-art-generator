  "prompt": "Background Context:\nProject Context:\n- set_theme: A vibrant cosmic voyage set blending Polynesian wayfinding culture with interstellar exploration.\n\nThe Vela Archipelago - scattered island-worlds across a nebula-sea where ancient wayfinders navigate \nusing both star charts and ancestral spirits. Their great canoe-ships ride cosmic currents between \nworlds, powered by mana drawn from volcanic cores and celestial convergences.\n\nKey themes:\n- Wayfinding: Navigation using stars, currents, and spirit guides across both ocean and space\n- Ancestor spirits: Departed navigators whose spirits guide the living through dangerous passages\n- Mana as fuel: Volcanic/stellar energy that powers both magic and interstellar travel\n- Tattoo magic (Tatau): Sacred markings that store power, record lineage, and enable abilities\n- The Great Voyage: An ongoing journey to unite scattered island-worlds under one chiefdom\n- Cosmic sea creatures: Massive beings that swim between stars - some helpful guides, others apex predators\n- Coral nebulae: Beautiful but treacherous regions of space filled with life and danger\n\nVisual motifs: Intricate tribal patterns, bioluminescent creatures, volcanic islands floating in starfields,\noutrigger starships with solar sails, warriors with glowing tattoos, coral formations in nebula clouds.\n\n- set_size: 6\n\nCurrent Asset:\n- name: Outrigger Star-Skiff\n- card_type: Artifact - Vehicle\n- rarity: Common\n- color: Colorless\n- concept: The Outrigger Star-Skiff represents the agile, everyday transport of the Vela Wayfinders, blending traditional canoe design with cosmic mana-propulsion for navigating nearby island-worlds and scouting. During the Great Voyage, these skiffs are vital for exploration and rapid deployment against the Void Blight, symbolizing the resilience of the Wayfinder people. Mechanically, it likely supports basic board presence and helps \"chart a course\" through the library, fitting its common rarity and wayfinding theme.\n- mechanics_brainstorm: Here are 10 possible mechanical designs for the \"Outrigger Star-Skiff,\" taking into account its common rarity, concept, and the set's mechanics and themes:\n\n---\n\n1.  {2}, 2/2, Crew 1.
