  "prompt": "Background Context:\nProject Context:\n- set_theme: A vibrant cosmic voyage set blending Polynesian wayfinding culture with interstellar exploration.\n\nThe Vela Archipelago - scattered island-worlds across a nebula-sea where ancient wayfinders navigate \nusing both star charts and ancestral spirits. Their great canoe-ships ride cosmic currents between \nworlds, powered by mana drawn from volcanic cores and celestial convergences.\n\nKey themes:\n- Wayfinding: Navigation using stars, currents, and spirit guides across both ocean and space\n- Ancestor spirits: Departed navigators whose spirits guide the living through dangerous passages\n- Mana as fuel: Volcanic/stellar energy that powers both magic and interstellar travel\n- Tattoo magic (Tatau): Sacred markings that store power, record lineage, and enable abilities\n- The Great Voyage: An ongoing journey to unite scattered island-worlds under one chiefdom\n- Cosmic sea creatures: Massive beings that swim between stars - some helpful guides, others apex predators\n- Coral nebulae: Beautiful but treacherous regions of space filled with life and danger\n\nVisual motifs: Intricate tribal patterns, bioluminescent creatures, volcanic islands floating in starfields,\noutrigger starships with solar sails, warriors with glowing tattoos, coral formations in nebula clouds.\n\n- set_size: 6\n\nCurrent Asset:\n- name: Outrigger Star-Skiff\n- card_type: Artifact - Vehicle\n- rarity: Common\n- color: Colorless\n- concept: The Outrigger Star-Skiff is a common, nimble vessel used by individual Wayfinders for swift travel and reconnaissance across the nebula-sea, embodying their ingenuity and connection to cosmic currents. It represents the everyday transportation of the Vela people, crucial for exploring new routes and avoiding dangers during the early stages of the Void Blight's spread. Mechanically, it would be an efficient vehicle, likely offering a minor advantage in navigation or resource management upon crewing.\n- mechanics_brainstorm: Here are 10 possible mechanics for the \"Outrigger Star-Skiff\" card, designed for common rarity and fitting the set's themes:\n\n1.  **Whenever Outrigger Star-Skiff becomes crewed, scry 1.**\n    *   Complexity 2. Flavor 5. Synergy 5.\n    *   *Justification:* Directly embodies \"navigation\" and \"reconnaissance\" by allowing the Wayfinder to peer into the cosmic currents and chart their course. Uses a core set mechanic.\n\n2.  **Whenever Outrigger Star-Skiff becomes crewed, reveal the top card of your library. If it's a land card, put it into your hand. Otherwise, put it on the bottom of your library.**\n    *   Complexity 3. Flavor 4. Synergy 4.\n    *   *Justification:* A simplified \"explore\" mechanic focused on resource management and \"discovering new island-worlds\" or finding the right path.\n\n3.  **Flying**\n    *   Complexity 1. Flavor 4. Synergy 3.\n    *   *Justification:* Represents the \"nimble vessel\" traveling swiftly through the \"nebula-sea\" above other obstacles.\n\n4.  **As long as Outrigger Star-Skiff is a creature, it has haste.**\n    *   Complexity 2. Flavor 4. Synergy 3.\n    *   *Justification:* Emphasizes \"swift travel\" and a \"nimble vessel\" that can quickly engage or disengage.\n\n5.  **When Outrigger Star-Skiff enters the battlefield, scry 1.**\n    *   Complexity 2. Flavor 4. Synergy 4.\n    *   *Justification:* Represents the initial \"reconnaissance\" or charting of a course upon deploying the vessel. Uses a core set mechanic.\n\n6.  **Whenever Outrigger Star-Skiff becomes crewed, untap target land you control.**\n    *   Complexity 2. Flavor 3. Synergy 3.\n    *   *Justification:* Provides a minor \"resource management\" advantage, allowing the Wayfinder to utilize mana efficiently for further actions or spells.\n\n7.  **Whenever Outrigger Star-Skiff becomes crewed, add {C}.**\n    *   Complexity 2. Flavor 3. Synergy 3.\n    *   *Justification:* Represents the siphoning of a small amount of \"mana as fuel\" to power the journey or additional spells, offering a minor \"resource management\" benefit.\n\n8.  **Ward {1}**\n    *   Complexity 1. Flavor 3. Synergy 2.\n    *   *Justification:* Represents the \"nimble\" nature of the skiff, making it slightly harder for opponents to disrupt its reconnaissance missions.\n\n9.  **Vigilance**\n    *   Complexity 1. Flavor 3. Synergy 2.\n    *   *Justification:* Fits the \"reconnaissance\" aspect, as the skiff and its pilot are always alert and ready to defend even after attacking.\n\n10. **Whenever Outrigger Star-Skiff deals combat damage to a player, scry 1.**\n    *   Complexity 2. Flavor 4. Synergy 4.\n    *   *Justification:* Represents gaining new information or \"navigation\" insights through successful \"reconnaissance\" during an encounter. Uses a core set mechanic.\n\nPrevious Step 'design_set_mechanics':\nHere is the mechanical framework for your Magic: The Gathering set, \"The Vela Archipelago\":\n\n---\n\n## 1.
