Their great canoe-ships ride cosmic currents between \nworlds, powered by mana drawn from volcanic cores and celestial convergences.\n\nKey themes:\n- Wayfinding: Navigation using stars, currents, and spirit guides across both ocean and space\n- Ancestor spirits: Departed navigators whose spirits guide the living through dangerous passages\n- Mana as fuel: Volcanic/stellar energy that powers both magic and interstellar travel\n- Tattoo magic (Tatau): Sacred markings that store power, record lineage, and enable abilities\n- The Great Voyage: An ongoing journey to unite scattered island-worlds under one chiefdom\n- Cosmic sea creatures: Massive beings that swim between stars - some helpful guides, others apex predators\n- Coral nebulae: Beautiful but treacherous regions of space filled with life and danger\n\nVisual motifs: Intricate tribal patterns, bioluminescent creatures, volcanic islands floating in starfields,\noutrigger starships with solar sails, warriors with glowing tattoos, coral formations in nebula clouds.\n\n- set_size: 6\n\nCurrent Asset:\n- name: Vela Wayfinder Initiate\n- card_type: Creature - Human Warrior\n- rarity: Common\n- color: White\n- concept: The Vela Wayfinder Initiate embodies the youngest generation of star-sailors, their sacred *tatau* just beginning to glow as they learn to read the cosmic currents and ancestral star-charts. They represent the hopeful future of the Wayfinder Chiefdom, diligently training to uphold the Great Voyage and stand against the encroaching Void Blight. Mechanically, they serve as an early guide, helping players chart their course by allowing them to look ahead into their library and prepare for the journey.\n- mechanics_brainstorm: Here are 10 possible mechanics/abilities for the \"Vela Wayfinder Initiate\" card:\n\n1.
