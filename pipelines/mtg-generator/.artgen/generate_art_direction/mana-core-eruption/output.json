This rare red sorcery delivers a powerful, potentially costly, burst of temporary mana or a devastating, widespread damage effect, showcasing the raw, untamed energy that fuels the Vela Archipelago.\n- mechanics_brainstorm: Here are 10 possible mechanical designs for \"Mana-Core Eruption\", keeping in mind its Red color, Rare rarity, and the set's themes and mechanics:\n\n---\n\n1.  **Oracle Text:** \"Choose one:\n    *   Add X red mana to your mana pool, where X is the number of lands you control. This mana empties from your mana pool at the end of this turn.\n    *   Mana-Core Eruption deals X damage to each creature and each opponent, where X is the number of lands you control. You lose X life.\"\n    *   **Complexity:** 7. (Modal 3, X-value from lands 2, temporary mana 1, widespread damage 2, life loss 1).\n    *   **Flavor Fit:** 5. Directly represents the volatile choice between a massive mana surge or a devastating, self-harming blast from the island's core, scaled by its foundation (lands).\n    *   **Synergy:** 5. Excellent synergy with **Landfall** (as X scales with lands). The mana burst fuels **Prowess** for a follow-up spell barrage, while the damage is classic Red aggression.\n\n2.  **Oracle Text:** \"Mana-Core Eruption deals 3 damage to each creature and each opponent. If a land entered the battlefield under your control this turn, instead add RRRRR to your mana pool and draw a card. This mana empties from your mana pool at the end of this turn.\"\n    *   **Complexity:** 7. (Fixed damage 2, conditional \"instead\" effect 3, temporary mana 1, draw a card 1).\n    *   **Flavor Fit:** 4. An initial rupture that either devastates or, if you've recently tapped into new land-mana (a fresh connection), yields a powerful, insightful burst.\n    *   **Synergy:** 5. Strong **Landfall** synergy (condition for the powerful mana/draw effect). The mana burst directly fuels **Prowess** spells.\n\n3.  **Oracle Text:** \"Mana-Core Eruption deals X damage to each creature. You lose X life. Add X red mana to your mana pool. This mana can only be spent to cast instants or sorceries. (X can't be 0.)\"\n    *   **Complexity:** 7. (Player-chosen X 2, widespread damage 2, life loss 1, temporary conditional mana 2).\n    *   **Flavor Fit:** 5. The ultimate volatile, costly burst: devastating to the surroundings and the caster, but providing immense, focused power for magical eruptions.\n    *   **Synergy:** 4. Highly synergistic with **Prowess**, providing tailored mana for noncreature spells. The damage clears the way for potential attacks.\n\n4.  **Oracle Text:** \"As an additional cost to cast this spell, sacrifice a land.\n    Choose one:\n    *   Mana-Core Eruption deals 5 damage to each creature and each opponent.\n    *   Add RRRRRR to your mana pool. This mana empties from your mana pool at the end of this turn. Until end of turn, whenever you cast a noncreature spell, create a 1/1 red Elemental creature token.\"\n    *   **Complexity:** 8. (Additional cost 2, Modal 3. Option 1: widespread damage 2. Option 2: temporary mana 1, triggered token creation 2).\n    *   **Flavor Fit:** 5. Sacrificing an island-world (land) to unleash its core's full power, either as a singular devastating blast or a sustained, spell-fueled token generation representing smaller eruptions.\n    *   **Synergy:** 5. The sacrifice can enable graveyard strategies. The tokens synergize with **Vehicles** (crewing) and **Prowess** (if they trigger from casting noncreature spells, or simply provide bodies for the board). Mana fuels **Prowess**.\n\n5.  **Oracle Text:** \"Mana-Core Eruption deals damage equal to the number of lands you control to each creature. Add red mana equal to the number of lands you control to your mana pool. This mana empties from your mana pool at the end of this turn.\"\n    *   **Complexity:** 6. (Calculation for X twice 3, widespread damage 2, temporary mana 1).\n    *   **Flavor Fit:** 5. The magnitude of the eruption (both destructive and generative) is directly proportional to the foundational strength of your island-worlds (lands).\n    *   **Synergy:** 5. Excellent **Landfall** synergy (more lands, more power). The mana burst directly fuels **Prowess** spells.\n\n6.  **Oracle Text:** \"Mana-Core Eruption deals 5 damage to target creature or planeswalker. For each excess damage dealt this way, add {R} to your mana pool. This mana empties from your mana pool at the end of this turn. Draw a card if at least one mana was added this way.\"\n    *   **Complexity:** 6. (Targeted damage 1, excess damage calculation 3, temporary mana 1, conditional draw 1).\n    *   **Flavor Fit:** 4. The eruption's raw power is so immense that any \"overkill\" is converted into usable mana, even providing a moment of clarity (draw) for efficiently harnessing it.\n    *   **Synergy:** 3. Provides targeted removal, and the temporary mana can fuel **Prowess** spells. Clears the way for **Vehicles**.\n\n7.  **Oracle Text:** \"Mana-Core Eruption deals 2 damage to each creature. Add red mana equal to the number of noncreature spells you've cast this turn to your mana pool. This mana empties from your mana pool at the end of this turn. Until end of turn, if you would cast a noncreature spell, it costs {R} less to cast.\"\n    *   **Complexity:** 6. (Fixed damage 1, X-mana based on spells 2, temporary mana 1, cost reduction 2).\n    *   **Flavor Fit:** 4. A widespread initial tremor, then the core fuels a rapid succession of spells, each one less taxing due to the ongoing eruption.\n    *   **Synergy:** 5. Extremely high **Prowess** synergy, both generating mana for and reducing the cost of subsequent noncreature spells, enabling explosive turns.\n\n8.  **Oracle Text:** \"Exile the top X cards of your library, where X is the number of lands you control. Until the end of your next turn, you may cast nonland cards exiled this way. Mana-Core Eruption deals X damage to target opponent.\"\n    *   **Complexity:** 6. (X-value from lands 2, exile for casting 3, targeted damage 1).\n    *   **Flavor Fit:** 3. Representing a desperate delve into the core's unknown depths for resources, potentially causing a backlash (damage) to an enemy.\n    *   **Synergy:** 4. Helps dig for spells to fuel **Prowess**, and direct damage is a core Red strategy. Scalable with **Landfall**.\n\n9.  **Oracle Text:** \"Roll a six-sided die. Mana-Core Eruption deals damage equal to the result to each creature. Add red mana equal to the result to your mana pool. This mana empties from your mana pool at the end of this turn.\"\n    *   **Complexity:** 6. (Dice roll 3, widespread damage 2, temporary mana 1).\n    *   **Flavor Fit:** 5. Captures the raw, unpredictable volatility of a mana-core rupture, with outcomes ranging from a minor tremor to a cataclysmic blast.\n    *   **Synergy:** 4. Provides variable board control and variable mana for **Prowess** spells, leaning into Red's chaotic nature.\n\n10. **Oracle Text:** \"As an additional cost to cast this spell, sacrifice a land or discard a card.\n    Mana-Core Eruption deals 3 damage to each creature and each opponent. Until end of turn, spells you cast cost {R} less to cast, but you can only cast one more spell this turn.\"\n    *   **Complexity:** 7. (Additional cost 2, widespread damage 2, cost reduction 2, restriction 1).\n    *   **Flavor Fit:** 5. A desperate, costly act (sacrificing a resource) for a powerful, but ultimately limited, final push or defense.\n    *   **Synergy:** 4. Fuels a single, powerful follow-up spell (good for **Prowess** if it's a noncreature spell) after a board-clearing burst of damage, aligning with Red's aggressive, decisive nature.\n- card_json: ```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"Mana-Core Eruption\",\n  \"supertype\": \"Sorcery\",\n  \"subtype\": null,\n  \"mana_cost\": \"{2}{R}\",\n  \"power\": null,\n  \"toughness\": null,\n  \"rule_text\": \"As an additional cost to cast this spell, sacrifice a land.\\nChoose one:\\n\u2022 Mana-Core Eruption deals 5 damage to each creature and each opponent.\\n\u2022 Add {R}{R}{R}{R}{R}{R} to your mana pool.

Once, these worlds were part of a single, vibrant planet, shattered by a cataclysmic event long forgotten. From the fragments arose the scattered landmasses, each bearing a segment of the ancient world, now cradled by cosmic currents and bathed in starlight. The sky is a perpetual twilight canvas of deep blues, purples, and vibrant greens where nebulae bloom like coral reefs and constellations chart not just seasons, but entire interstellar pathways.\n\nThe people of Vela, descendants of the original inhabitants, are the Wayfinders. Their culture is deeply intertwined with their environment. Their great canoe-ships, crafted from resilient cosmic timbers and powered by mana drawn from volcanic cores and celestial convergences, are not mere vessels but extensions of their spirit. Navigation is a sacred art, blending empirical star-charts with the intuitive guidance of ancestral spirits, who manifest as shimmering specters of light and memory. Mana, the lifeblood of the cosmos, courses through everything \u2013 it's the fuel for their starships, the essence of their magic (etched into their skin as protective and empowering *Tatau*), and the very breath of their floating worlds. The Great Voyage, an ongoing mission passed down through generations, is the collective dream to reunite the scattered island-worlds under one Chiefdom, believing that only through unity can they restore the balance of their fragmented home. Cosmic sea creatures, from helpful, bioluminescent guides to colossal, predatory horrors, navigate these stellar currents alongside the Wayfinders, embodying both the wonder and the danger of the nebula-sea.\n\n### The Conflict\n\nThe Great Voyage faces an existential threat. A creeping corruption, known as the **Void Blight**, has begun to spread through the nebula-sea. Cosmic currents turn treacherous, once-benevolent creatures become aggressive, and the vibrant coral nebulae wither into skeletal husks. Mana channels grow unstable, siphoning strength from island-worlds and leaving them vulnerable. This Blight is not a natural phenomenon; it's the manifestation of a malevolent, ancient entity \u2013 the **Mana Devourer** \u2013 awakened by reckless mana extraction and forgotten rituals. The Devourer seeks to consume all mana, shattering the remaining island-worlds and plunging the archipelago into eternal void. This rising darkness is being actively aided by **High Priestess Xylara**, a powerful but misguided shaman who believes that by feeding the Blight, she can control its power and forge a new, ruthless order. The Wayfinders must now unite, not just for prosperity, but for survival, before the Vela Archipelago is devoured.\n\n### Key Characters\n\n1.  **Chief Moana'ali, the Guiding Star** (WU) - *Legendary Hero, Human Wayfinder*\n    *   **Role:** The visionary leader of the primary Wayfinder tribe on Aetheria. Moana'ali is a master navigator, renowned for her ability to \"scry\" the cosmic currents and her unwavering commitment to the Great Voyage. She embodies hope, wisdom, and the communal spirit, actively seeking to unite the scattered peoples against the Void Blight. Her *Tatau* glows with the patterns of guiding constellations.\n2.  **Kaelen, Speaker to the Leviathans** (UG) - *Legendary Hero, Merfolk Druid*\n    *   **Role:** A solitary yet powerful Merfolk, deeply attuned to the primal mana of the Coral Nebulae and the will of the cosmic sea creatures. Kaelen often communicates through song and empathic resonance, guiding colossal leviathans and understanding the subtle shifts in the nebula's health. He is crucial in understanding the Blight's true impact and enlisting the aid of ancient cosmic guardians. His skin bears natural, bioluminescent *Tatau* patterns.\n3.  **High Priestess Xylara, of the Obsidian Heart** (BR) - *Legendary Villain, Human Shaman*\n    *   **Role:** A ruthless and ambitious shaman who leads a faction of Wayfinders that have embraced the power of the Void Blight. Xylara believes the Blight is a necessary evolutionary step, a means to shed weakness and gain ultimate power. She performs dark rituals, sacrificing mana and even lives to empower her followers and accelerate the Blight's spread, believing she can ultimately control the Mana Devourer. Her *Tatau* are stark, black, and constantly shift like flowing shadows.\n4.  **The Mana Devourer** (B) - *Legendary Villain, Eldrazi/Horror Spirit*\n    *   **Role:** The ancient, malevolent entity behind the Void Blight. It manifests as a swirling vortex of corrupted mana and shadowy tendrils, utterly devoid of physical form but capable of siphoning the life force from worlds and beings. It whispers promises of power to Xylara while slowly consuming the archipelago, seeking to return everything to a primal void state.\n5.  **Jori, Starship Captain of the *Mana Runner*** (RW) - *Supporting Character, Human Warrior*\n    *   **Role:** A daring and charismatic starship captain, Jori pilots one of the fastest outrigger starships in the fleet. He is fiercely loyal to Moana'ali and leads scouting missions and skirmishes against Xylara's raiders, renowned for his courage and tactical prowess. His vibrant *Tatau* pulse with volcanic energy, granting him swiftness and precision.\n6.  **Elder Mara, Keeper of the Deep Rites** (GB) - *Supporting Character, Human Cleric/Shaman*\n    *   **Role:** The oldest and wisest of Moana'ali's council, Elder Mara possesses an encyclopedic knowledge of ancient rituals, prophecies, and the true nature of mana. She delves into forgotten histories and communions with ancestral spirits to find a way to combat the Void Blight, even if it means uncovering dangerous truths. Her ancient *Tatau* are almost entirely faded but radiate an inner calm.\n\n### Important Locations\n\n1.  **Aetheria, the First Isle:** The largest and most central island-world, serving as the spiritual and political heart of the Wayfinder Chiefdom. Its towering volcanic peak is a primary mana nexus, and its harbors teem with grand starships. It is here that Chief Moana'ali rallies her people.\n2.  **The Whispering Void:** A vast, desolate region of space where the vibrant Coral Nebulae have withered into skeletal, crystalline formations. This is the heart of the Void Blight's influence, where the Mana Devourer's presence is strongest and corrupted cosmic creatures lurk in oppressive darkness.\n3.  **The Living Reef of Lumina:** A breathtaking expanse of bioluminescent coral nebulae, home to an astonishing array of vibrant, mana-rich flora and fauna, including ancient leviathans. It's a source of immense power and life, but also incredibly delicate and the first place Kaelen senses the Blight's insidious spread.\n4.  **The Obsidian Crag:** High Priestess Xylara's stronghold, a volcanic island whose core mana has been siphoned and corrupted. Its surface is scarred with dark runes and sacrificial altars, powered by the dying mana of the archipelago, providing a grim contrast to Aetheria.\n\n### Timeline of Events\n\n1.  **The Unsettling Calm:** The set opens with an uneasy peace. Isolated reports of unpredictable cosmic currents, strangely aggressive smaller cosmic creatures, and unusual mana fluctuations begin to reach Aetheria. Chief Moana'ali and Elder Mara sense a growing imbalance.\n2.  **The Blight's First Strike:** A remote island-world, a vibrant coral nebula, and a Wayfinder scouting fleet are abruptly consumed or corrupted by the rapidly expanding Void Blight. Survivors describe shimmering shadows and a suffocating void, causing widespread panic and proving the existential threat.\n3.  **The Call to Arms & Ancient Wisdom:** Moana'ali formally declares the Great Voyage is now a desperate fight for survival, calling for all scattered island-worlds to unite. Simultaneously, Kaelen embarks on a journey into the Living Reef of Lumina to seek counsel from ancient leviathans, learning more about the Mana Devourer's true nature. Elder Mara consults ancient lore and ancestral spirits, discovering forgotten rituals to combat such cosmic threats.\n4.  **Xylara's Ascendance:** High Priestess Xylara, already a charismatic figure, emerges with her faction from the Obsidian Crag. She claims the Void Blight is a divine purging and begins raiding mana-rich sites and small island-worlds, performing dark sacrifices to \"feed\" the Devourer, believing she can harness its power to bring about a new order. Her forces clash with Jori's starship fleet, leading to fierce battles across the nebula.\n5.  **Desperate Alliances:** Moana'ali's fleet, spearheaded by Jori, navigates perilous cosmic currents and battles corrupted creatures and Xylara's raiders to reach isolated island-worlds, convincing their wary chiefs to join the unified front. Each successful alliance strengthens the Chiefdom's collective *Tatau* and mana.\n6.  **Revelation at the Whispering Void:** Following Kaelen's visions and Elder Mara's prophecies, the unified Wayfinder fleet makes a perilous journey to the Whispering Void. They discover the Mana Devourer is not just spreading influence but actively manifesting, a colossal, ethereal horror attempting to completely sever the remaining mana connections between island-worlds. Xylara prepares a massive, final sacrifice to the Devourer, hoping to become its supreme conduit.\n7.  **The Great Reckoning:** A climactic battle erupts. Moana'ali leads the charge, rallying her people and ancestors. Kaelen summons ancient cosmic guardians from Lumina. Jori's fleet engages Xylara's raiders in a desperate starship dogfight. Elder Mara, guided by ancestral spirits, attempts a powerful, dangerous ritual to disrupt the Mana Devourer's connection to the archipelago. The fate of Vela hangs in the balance, a vibrant struggle of unity, spirit, and raw mana against the encroaching void.\n\nThink through the art direction:\n\n## Central Subject\nWhat is the main focus of the image?\n\n## Character Details (if applicable)\n- Appearance, clothing, expression\n- Action/pose\n- Cultural influences\n\n## Scene & Setting  \n- Location/background\n- Time of day, lighting\n- Weather/atmosphere\n\n## Mood & Tone\n- Emotional feeling\n- Color palette\n- Level of drama/action\n\n## Style References\n- Art movement or style\n- Reference artists (fantasy artists work well)\n\nNow write the final prompt:\n\nFinal Prompt: \"[A detailed prompt for image generation, 1-3 sentences]\"\n\nArtist Credit: [Artist name to credit on the card, e.g. \"inspired by Frank Frazetta\"]\n",
