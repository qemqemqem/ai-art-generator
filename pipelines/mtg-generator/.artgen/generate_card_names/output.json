The land itself is cursed, and humanity struggles against overwhelming supernatural threats, often becoming monsters themselves in the process.\n\n## 1. Existing Mechanics (6)\n\n1.  **Transform** (Double-Faced Cards)\n    *   **Rules Reminder:** Cards with Transform have two faces. A specific condition will cause them to flip from one face to the other.\n    *   **Why it fits the theme:** This mechanic is perfect for representing the core themes of mutation, monstrous change, and the dual nature of creatures like werewolves, but also humans cursed into vampires, ghouls, or other horrors. It adds a dynamic, unpredictable element to the battlefield.\n    *   **Colors:** Primarily Green, Red, and Black, with some in Blue and White for specific transformations (e.g., scholar into mad creature, virtuous human into ghoul).\n\n2.  **Daybound/Nightbound**\n    *   **Rules Reminder:** A variant of Transform, primarily used for Werewolves. If a player casts no spells during their own turn, it becomes Night (and Daybound permanents transform to their Nightbound side). If a player casts two or more spells during their own turn, it becomes Day (and Nightbound permanents transform to their Daybound side).\n    *   **Why it fits the theme:** Directly represents the iconic moon cycle that governs werewolves, a cornerstone of Eastern European monster lore. It adds a natural, cyclical rhythm to the game that players must adapt to.\n    *   **Colors:** Predominantly Green and Red (for Werewolves).\n\n3.  **Blood (Tokens)**\n    *   **Rules Reminder:** Blood is an artifact token with \"1, Tap, Discard a card, Sacrifice this artifact: Draw a card.\"\n    *   **Why it fits the theme:** Directly associated with vampires and their life-draining nature. It also represents dark rituals, desperate acts, or the raw essence of life that can be used for various effects in a gothic horror setting. Provides valuable card filtering and sacrifice fodder.\n    *   **Colors:** Primarily Black and Red, with some representation in Blue (blood magic) and White (ritual offerings).\n\n4.  **Curses (Enchantment Subtype)**\n    *   **Rules Reminder:** Curses are Auras that enchant a player, typically providing a detrimental effect to that player.\n    *   **Why it fits the theme:** Explicitly addresses the \"ancient curses\" aspect of the set. These represent the lingering, insidious magic that plagues the land and its inhabitants, affecting players with ongoing drawbacks.\n    *   **Colors:** Black (classic doom and decay), Blue (mental anguish, slow decline), Red (unleashed fury, destructive urges), Green (nature's wrath), and potentially White (divine punishment, excommunication).\n\n5.  **Flashback**\n    *   **Rules Reminder:** You may cast this card from your graveyard for its flashback cost. If you do, exile it instead of putting it anywhere else any time it would leave the stack.\n    *   **Why it fits the theme:** Represents the lingering magic of forgotten rituals, ancient spells rediscovered, spectral echoes of the past, or the persistent nature of dark forces that refuse to stay dead. Perfect for spells associated with necromancy, old lore, or ghostly activity.\n    *   **Colors:** Blue (forbidden knowledge, ancient wisdom), Black (necromancy, resurrection), Red (desperate measures, fiery vengeance).\n\n6.  **Morbid**\n    *   **Rules Reminder:** An ability word that grants an additional effect if a creature died this turn.\n    *   **Why it fits the theme:** Gothic horror is replete with death, sacrifice, and the consequences of creatures dying. Morbid triggers highlight the cycle of life and death, empowering spells and creatures that feed on the battlefield's casualties.\n    *   **Colors:** Black (death, sacrifice, decay), Green (nature's cycle, scavenging), Red (bloodlust, vengeance).\n\n## 2. Signature Mechanic (1 New)\n\n**Name:** **Torment**\n**Rules Text:** \"Torment N (Whenever you cast a spell with Torment, or a permanent with Torment enters the battlefield, put N torment counters on target opponent. At the beginning of that player's upkeep, if they have one or more torment counters, they lose 1 life. Then they remove a torment counter from themselves.)\"\n\n*   **Flavor Justification:** Represents a lingering curse, a slow psychological decay, or the cumulative suffering inflicted by dark forces. It's a persistent, draining effect that opponents must endure, embodying the creeping dread and inescapable doom prevalent in gothic horror. It forces players to reckon with an escalating threat that punishes inaction.\n*   **Complexity Level:** 2 (Requires tracking counters on players, which is a rare but established mechanic, and involves a straightforward triggered ability during upkeep.)\n\n## 3. Color Themes\n\n**White: Desperate Defenders & Corrupted Zealots**\n*   **Thematic Role:** Represents the beleaguered human villages, the monster hunters, and the religious orders trying to fight back the darkness. Often, their resolve can become twisted into zealous fanaticism or desperate acts of self-preservation, leading to corruption or unintended cruelty.\n*   **Primary Mechanics:** Protection, defensive creatures, token generation (militia), creature buffs, some life gain (healing), Morbid (sacrificing to protect others), Curse interaction (exorcism).\n*   **Creature Types:** Human Soldier, Human Knight, Human Cleric, Spirit (protective/vengeful), Angel (often fallen or zealous), Vampire (converted, rare).\n\n**Blue: Forbidden Knowledge & Maddened Seers**\n*   **Thematic Role:** Focuses on ancient secrets, forbidden research, alchemical experiments gone wrong, and the unraveling of sanity. Blue characters are often scholars, seers, or alchemists who delve too deep into the darkness, encountering mind-controlling spirits or succumbing to madness themselves.\n*   **Primary Mechanics:** Card draw/selection (research), counterspells (wards, secrets), tap/untap, mind manipulation, Flashback (ancient spells), Transform (into mutated forms), Curses (mental decay, confusion), some Torment (psychological dread).\n*   **Creature Types:** Human Wizard, Spirit (ghosts, specters), Illusion, Shapeshifter (changelings), Homunculus, Vampire (mind-bound, less common).\n\n**Black: Ancient Evil & Undead Hordes**\n*   **Thematic Role:** The heart of the horror. Dominating vampires, necromancers raising ghastly armies, witches making dark pacts, and malevolent spirits seeking to torment the living. This color embodies death, decay, sacrifice, hunger for power, and absolute control.\n*   **Primary Mechanics:** Sacrifice, reanimation (Flashback), direct creature removal, hand disruption, Blood tokens, Curses (doom, decay), Morbid, Torment.\n*   **Creature Types:** Vampire, Zombie, Ghoul, Skeleton, Human Warlock, Witch, Demon, Spirit (malevolent).\n\n**Red: Primal Fury & Feral Instincts**\n*   **Thematic Role:** Embodies the raw, untamed nature of werewolves, the desperate rage of villagers pushed to their limits, pyromancers wielding uncontrolled magic, and vengeful spirits. It\u2019s about impulsive action, destruction, and unchecked aggression.\n*   **Primary Mechanics:** Aggression, direct damage, sacrifice (desperate acts), Transform (werewolves), Daybound/Nightbound, Blood tokens (frenzy), Morbid (fueled by death), Curses (rage, impulsive destruction), some Torment.\n*   **Creature Types:** Human Barbarian, Werewolf, Wolf, Goblin (savage, desperate), Spirit (vengeful), Vampire (feral, brutal).\n\n**Green: Untamed Wilds & Corrupted Nature**\n*   **Thematic Role:** Represents the ancient, encroaching forests, the wild animals, nature-bound spirits, and druids who draw power from the land. Nature itself can be a source of strength, but also corrupted by ancient evils, giving rise to monstrous plant life or feral beasts.\n*   **Primary Mechanics:** Large creatures, creature buffs, mana ramp, fight spells, Transform (werewolves), Daybound/Nightbound, Morbid (nature's cycle of death and rebirth), some Flashback (ancient rituals), some Torment (natural decay).\n*   **Creature Types:** Werewolf, Wolf, Bear, Beast, Treefolk, Human Druid, Spirit (nature-bound), Plant (corrupted).\n\n## 4. Draft Archetypes (10)\n\n*   **WU (Spirit & Enchantment Control):** Utilize White's defensive spells and Blue's evasive Spirits to control the board, while leveraging Curses and other enchantments to slowly grind out opponents. A methodical, secret-uncovering playstyle.\n*   **WB (Sacrifice & Reanimation):** Exploit White's token generation and Black's sacrifice outlets to enable Morbid triggers and fill the graveyard, then reanimate powerful threats. Focus on life drain and resource denial.\n*   **WR (Aggro & Mob Justice):** A highly aggressive strategy focused on overwhelming the opponent with Humans and Werewolves. Red's direct damage and White's combat boosts create a fast, impactful assault. Morbid effects are triggered by the inevitable casualties.\n*   **WG (Token Swarm & Ancient Protectors):** Generates a wide board of Human and Wolf tokens, then uses Green's buffs and White's anthems to create a formidable army. Werewolves provide powerful transforming threats, embodying the wild's defense.\n*   **UB (Cursed Knowledge & Graveyard Control):** Combines Blue's disruption and Black's removal with Flashback and Curses. Focuses on controlling the opponent's hand and board, while using the graveyard as a resource to cast spells and enable powerful effects.\n*   **UR (Spellslinger & Chaotic Rituals):** Uses Blue's card advantage and Red's direct damage spells, heavily leveraging Flashback for spell recursion. Werewolves or other transforming creatures can benefit from spell support, or flip into powerful threats. Chaotic, unpredictable magic.\n*   **UG (Mutating Horrors & Ramp):** Ramps mana with Green to cast large, monstrous creatures, which can be augmented or transformed by Blue's shapeshifting magic. Focuses on developing a dominant board state with creatures that grow or mutate.\n*   **BR (Vampire Aggro & Bloodlust):** An aggressive strategy built around Vampires and Werewolves. Utilizes Blood tokens for card filtering and to fuel aggressive plays. Direct damage, sacrifice, and combat tricks combine for a relentless assault.\n*   **BG (Morbid Graveyard & Big Monsters):** Fills the graveyard through sacrifice and self-mill to enable powerful Morbid triggers and reanimate large Green or Black creatures. Embodies nature's decay feeding unholy power.\n*   **RG (Werewolf Aggro & Primal Power):** The quintessential Werewolf archetype. Aggressive creatures that thrive on Daybound/Nightbound transformations. Uses Green's creature buffs and Red's combat prowess to dominate the battlefield with primal force.\n\n## 5. Art Direction\n\n**Color Palette:**\n*   **Dominant:** A somber, desaturated palette featuring deep blues (moonlit nights, shadowed skies), slate grays (crumbling stone, oppressive fog), and murky greens (dense, ancient forests, decay).\n*   **Accents:** Striking crimson reds (blood, vampire eyes, desperate fire, ritualistic magic), sickly yellows and pale greens (disease, ancient corruption, ghostly emanations), and bone whites (skeletal remains, pallid skin, desperate light).\n*   **Overall Feel:** Oppressive, grim, mysterious, and atmospheric, with moments of sharp, visceral contrast that highlight violence or unnatural power.\n\n**Artistic Influences:**\n*   **Romanticism & Gothic Art:** Drawing from artists like Caspar David Friedrich for desolate, monumental landscapes and ruined architecture, and Francisco Goya for visceral, emotionally charged depictions of human struggle and monstrosity. Gustave Dor\u00e9's intricate engravings provide inspiration for detailed, dramatic scenes.\n*   **Classical Horror Cinema:** The atmospheric elegance of Hammer Films (rich colors, dramatic lighting, Victorian gothic aesthetics) combined with the iconic creature designs of Universal Monsters (Dracula, The Wolf Man) for a timeless, chilling quality.\n*   **Eastern European Folklore Art:** Incorporating elements of darker, more stylized folk art, traditional woodcuts, and iconography depicting ancient, weathered villages, deep, menacing forests, and the imposing, often decrepit castles that dot the landscape.\n*   **Modern Dark Fantasy:** While grounded in older aesthetics, there's an influence from the immersive, often grotesque world-building of games like \"Bloodborne\" or \"Castlevania\" for creature design and environmental storytelling, but with a more earthy, less industrialized feel.\n\n**Key Visual Motifs:**\n*   **Architecture & Environment:** Crumbling, imposing castles and fortresses, desolate, snow-dusted or perpetually muddy villages, decaying churches with broken spires. Dense, ancient, and often hostile forests with gnarled trees. Perpetual fog, mist, and moonlight creating an ethereal, unsettling atmosphere.\n*   **Creatures:**\n    *   **Vampires:** Portrayed as aristocratic yet utterly predatory, often gaunt but powerful, clad in dark, opulent, yet slightly tattered finery. Pale skin, sharp features, glowing red eyes are common.\n    *   **Werewolves:** Feral, muscular, often hunched and powerful, depicted in various stages of transformation. Fur is matted and wild, expressions are animalistic and rage-filled.\n    *   **Humans:** Weathered, fearful villagers huddled in defiance; determined but desperate monster hunters with makeshift tools; zealous, often corrupted inquisitors. Clothing is period-appropriate, often practical and worn.\n    *   **Spirits/Ghosts:** Ethereal, often distorted or shadowed forms, with expressions of anguish, vengeance, or silent despair. Luminescent and translucent.\n    *   **Other Horrors:** Grotesque, often malformed creatures born from dark magic, ancient curses, or the corrupted natural world (ghouls, wights, chimeras, monstrous flora).\n*   **Magic & Rituals:** Wisps of dark, often sickly-colored energy; glowing runes on ancient artifacts or stone circles; spectral light; blood rituals depicted with disturbing detail; ancient tomes overflowing with forbidden knowledge.\n*   **Objects & Symbols:** Ancient, often tarnished religious symbols (crosses, icons); lanterns casting weak light against overwhelming darkness; hunting implements (stakes, silver weapons); gnarled wooden stakes; symbols of decay and entropy.\n*   **Weather:** A pervasive sense of cold, dampness, and gloom. Constant mist, heavy rain, sporadic lightning, and an eternal twilight or moonlit night emphasize isolation and dread.\n\nStory:\nIn the perpetually twilight realm of Valoria, the veil between worlds is thin, and ancient evils stir beneath a sky that weeps endless mists. This is the land of *Shadowfen Blight*, a place where hope is a fading ember and humanity clings to crumbling bastions against a rising tide of horror inspired by Eastern European folklore.\n\n## The World\n\nValoria is a realm steeped in a history of both ancient glory and profound tragedy. Once, noble houses and devout orders ruled, their castles piercing the sky and their villages bustling with life. But centuries ago, a cataclysmic event \u2014 a confluence of forbidden magic and a fracturing of the natural order \u2014 unleashed the **Shadow Blight**. This insidious curse didn't merely kill; it twisted. The once vibrant forests, like the ancient **Whisperwood**, became gnarled and menacing, giving rise to ravenous werewolves and corrupted nature spirits. Proud castles, such as **Castle Volkov**, became lairs for aristocratic vampires who preyed upon their former subjects. Even the land itself seems to suffer, its rivers sluggish with dark waters, its soil choked with decay.\n\nThe sun is a myth in Valoria, rarely piercing the oppressive canopy of cloud and mist. Villages like **Oakhaven** are grim fortifications, their inhabitants living in constant fear, their lives a desperate struggle against the encroaching darkness. Whispers of ancient rituals and forgotten gods echo through the desolate valleys, promising both salvation and utter damnation. Generations have known nothing but this perpetual dread, their resilience hardened, their faith often warped into fanaticism, and their humanity perpetually on the precipice of monstrous transformation.\n\n## The Conflict\n\nThe central conflict driving *Shadowfen Blight* is the intensification of the very curse that defines Valoria: the **Shadow Blight** itself. It's not merely a historical event, but an ancient, semi-sentient malevolence that has lain dormant, steadily draining life from the land. Now, it is stirring, awakening with an unprecedented hunger. This reawakening manifests as a terrifying surge in all forms of supernatural activity: werewolves transform with unholy frequency (Daybound/Nightbound cycles accelerate), vampires grow bolder and more numerous, forgotten horrors crawl from the **Sunken Fens**, and ancient curses resurface with devastating power.\n\nThe Shadow Blight is literally consuming Valoria, spreading like a creeping shadow that saps vitality, sanity, and hope. It amplifies existing evils, pushes the desperate to become monstrous, and threatens to transform the entire realm into a lifeless, blighted husk. Humanity and the few remaining benevolent forces are pushed to the absolute breaking point, forced to confront not just individual monsters, but the very essence of the pervasive evil that seeks to engulf their world. The survival of Valoria, and perhaps the very soul of its people, hangs in the balance.\n\n## Key Characters\n\n1.  **Father Dmitri (W):** A grizzled, battle-hardened cleric and the reluctant leader of the Church of the Penitent Flame in Oakhaven. His face is a roadmap of scars, his eyes bear the weight of countless lost souls. Wielding a heavy, silver-emblazoned holy symbol, Dmitri is a beacon of desperate resistance, rallying villagers with unwavering faith and grim determination. However, the relentless onslaught and the Shadow Blight's creeping influence force him to consider increasingly desperate, sometimes morally ambiguous, measures to protect his flock, tempting him towards zealotry.\n\n2.  **Lyra of the Whisperwood (RG):** A fierce and agile werewolf hunter, Lyra lives on the fringes of civilization, deep within the treacherous Whisperwood. Clad in tanned furs, armed with a silvered axe and an uncanny intuition, she stalks corrupted beasts and protects the delicate balance of the wild. Lyra possesses a primal connection to nature, but also a deep-seated fear of the very beasts she hunts, knowing the thin line between human and monster. She represents the untamed strength of the wilds, often finding herself shifting between calculated defense and feral, righteous rage.\n\n3.  **Lord Volkov, the Blood Thane (BR):** The ancient, charismatic, and utterly ruthless vampire lord of Castle Volkov. With pallid skin, piercing red eyes, and a predatory grace, Volkov embodies aristocratic cruelty and an insatiable hunger for power. He sees the awakening Shadow Blight as an opportunity, not a threat, seeking to harness its necrotic energies to solidify his dominion over Valoria and plunge the world into eternal night. He commands vast legions of lesser vampires and ghastly thralls, ever seeking more **Blood** for his dark rituals.\n\n4.  **Elias Thorne, the Hex-Weaver (UB):** Once a brilliant scholar, Elias delved too deep into the forbidden texts hidden within the **Obsidian Archives** beneath Castle Volkov. He is now a gaunt, mad necromancer, his mind shattered by the secrets he uncovered. Elias wields potent **Curses** and can reanimate grotesque armies, using his forbidden knowledge to unravel the Blight's mysteries. He believes he can control it, but the Blight only tightens its mental grip, twisting his spells and accelerating his descent into madness. He unleashes spells with frightening **Flashback** potency, drawing on forgotten lore.\n\n5.  **Old Elara (U):** A reclusive, ancient seer dwelling in a dilapidated hut on the edge of the Sunken Fens. Her mind is a fractured mosaic of forgotten lore and terrifying visions, a direct consequence of the Blight's influence on her psyche. She speaks in cryptic prophecies and riddles, often revealing truths too horrifying for the sane to comprehend. Elara is a living repository of Valoria's tragic history, often speaking in fragmented sentences that hint at past events, acting as a living source of ancient knowledge for **Flashback** spells.\n\n6.  **Kael, the Shadow-Marked (B/R):** A once-proud village warrior from Oakhaven, Kael fell victim to a potent ancient curse during a skirmish in the Sunken Fens. A creeping shadow now spreads across his skin, a physical manifestation of the **Torment** that slowly drains his life force and twists his mind. He fights with desperate fury, a visible symbol of the human struggle against inevitable corruption, teetering on the brink of a monstrous **Transform**ation. His eventual fate will be a grim reminder of the Blight's power.\n\n## Important Locations\n\n1.  **Castle Volkov:** Perched atop a jagged, mist-shrouded peak, this colossal, decaying fortress is the ancestral seat of Lord Volkov and the epicenter of the vampiric dominion. Its gothic spires are broken, its courtyards choked with weeds, yet within its darkened halls, ancient evils plot and thrive.\n2.  **The Whisperwood:** An immense, ancient forest, perpetually shrouded in an unnatural gloom. Its gnarled trees form an impenetrable canopy, and its depths are home to feral beasts, nature spirits, and the fearsome werewolf packs that emerge during the ever-shifting cycles of Daybound/Nightbound.\n3.  **Oakhaven Village:** A beleaguered human settlement, its sturdy wooden palisades and the central Church of the Penitent Flame representing humanity's last stand. It is a place of desperate defiance, constant vigil, and frequent, bloody skirmishes against the horrors from the wilds.\n4.  **The Sunken Fens:** A vast, treacherous wetland, perpetually cloaked in a thick, sickly mist. This boggy expanse is the suspected origin point of the Shadow Blight, teeming with grotesque horrors, festering with ancient magic, and holding secrets that could doom or save Valoria.\n5.  **The Obsidian Archives:** Hidden deep beneath Castle Volkov, this crumbling, labyrinthine library is filled with ancient, forbidden tomes and scrolls. It's here that Elias Thorne delves into necrotic lore, risking his sanity to uncover secrets about the Blight, often leaving behind a trail of reanimated horrors and newly unleashed Curses.\n\n## Timeline of Events\n\nThe story of *Shadowfen Blight* begins as Valoria plunges into its darkest hour. The perpetual mist thickens, clinging to everything like a shroud. Villagers in Oakhaven report increasingly aggressive attacks from newly transformed werewolves, their transformations accelerating with the Blight's strengthening influence (Daybound/Nightbound). Crops wither, livestock sicken, and strange, whispered voices plague the minds of the vulnerable, twisting their thoughts into despair and paranoia. People begin to succumb to strange maladies, leading to sudden, violent **Transform**ations into ghouls or feral beasts. The land itself is wracked with increasing **Torment**.\n\nSensing the Blight's awakening, Lord Volkov begins to mass his vampire legions within Castle Volkov, sending out bloodthirsty emissaries to secure fresh **Blood** and prepare for an ultimate, eternal night. Simultaneously, Elias Thorne, deep within the Obsidian Archives, frantically scours ancient texts, his mind fractured by the Blight's insidious whispers. He begins to unleash powerful, long-forgotten **Curses** and raises armies of the dead (Flashback, Morbid), believing he can control the burgeoning power, though in reality, he only serves to amplify it.\n\nFather Dmitri, witnessing the overwhelming surge of darkness, rallies the last vestiges of hope in Oakhaven. He directs the fortification of the village, leading desperate rites of exorcism and protection, often making hard choices that lead to sacrifice and **Morbid** consequences to save more lives. Lyra, tracking a new, monstrous breed of werewolf deep into the corrupted Whisperwood, observes the terrifying decay of nature itself. The forest, usually a source of strength, is now turning against its inhabitants, birthing grotesque plant horrors and maddened spirits. She encounters Kael, already visibly struggling against the shadow spreading across his arm, his mind slowly succumbing to a powerful **Torment** curse.\n\nAs the Blight intensifies, it begins to manifest physically. A creeping, spectral fog emanates from the Sunken Fens, draining the very vitality from creatures it touches. The attacks on Oakhaven become relentless, a wave of vampires, zombies, and corrupted beasts. Kael, fighting valiantly, finally succumbs to his curse, **Transform**ing into a monstrous, corrupted version of himself, a tragic testament to the Blight\u2019s power. Father Dmitri, pushed to the brink, finds himself sanctioning desperate, darker rituals, utilizing sacrifices and Morbid effects to stem the tide, his soul increasingly stained by the fight. Lyra embraces a controlled ferocity, using her primal instincts to fight fire with fire, her human side struggling to maintain control amidst the chaos.\n\nThe climax erupts as Lord Volkov and Elias Thorne make their move, both attempting to harness the Shadow Blight at its perceived source within the Sunken Fens. Volkov desires its power for endless vampiric rule, while Thorne seeks to bind it to his will through a grand, terrible ritual. Father Dmitri and Lyra, along with the few survivors, must unite to confront these two powerful villains, even as the Blight itself begins to fully coalesce, threatening to consume all of Valoria. The final confrontation is a desperate, bloody struggle, where heroes will face horrific choices, and victory, if it comes, will be stained with sacrifice and the bitter taste of ongoing dread. The Shadow Blight may be temporarily thwarted, but its roots run deep, leaving Valoria forever scarred, its future shrouded in the eternal mist.\n\nBALANCE REQUIREMENTS:\n- Colors: Distribute evenly across W, U, B, R, G (plus some colorless)\n- Rarities: ~50% Common, ~30% Uncommon, ~20% Rare\n- Types: Mix of creatures, instants, sorceries, enchantments, artifacts\n\nFor each card, output as a JSON array with name, type, rarity, and color:\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Moonlit Hunter\",\n    \"card_type\": \"Creature - Werewolf\",\n    \"rarity\": \"Uncommon\",\n    \"color\": \"Green\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Cryptborn Curse\",\n    \"card_type\": \"Enchantment - Aura Curse\",\n    \"rarity\": \"Rare\",\n    \"color\": \"Black\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\nGenerate all 6 cards now as a JSON array:\n"
