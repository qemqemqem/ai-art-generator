    "content": "This card should be a Black/White (Orzhov) Legendary Creature - Demon Cleric, reflecting its infernal nature combined with its rigid adherence to bureaucratic process. Its core mechanical identity centers on taxing opponents whenever their creatures die, forcing them to pay a mana \"filing fee\" or discard a card, truly embodying its annoying, paperwork-obsessed soul collection."
